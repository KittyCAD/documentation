We’ve been busy working towards our mission of building modern CAD and we wanted to update you all on what we’ve been up to!

In July, we were lucky to add Hannah Bollar as a co-founder and CTO. Hannah previously worked as a Render Pipeline SWE on the LookDev team at Pixar. We had been searching for someone with her background for quite some time and from our very first call with Hannah, we knew she was _the one_. We were envious of the animation world, they have moved forward in graphics technology leaving CAD platforms in the dust. She has a passion for graphics and GPUs from the vantage point of animation and gaming, which is the breath of fresh air we were looking to gain for our product.

Working with Hannah over the past 5 months has been an absolute joy. She’s not only a great engineer, teaching me a bunch about C++, but a great operational co-founder. Personally, I’ve loved being able to hack on KittyCAD with Hannah and we can’t wait to show you all what we’ve been working on!

In other big news, Jordan Noone has stepped up to be the CEO of KittyCAD! We can’t think of a better person to lead this company. Jordan has first-hand experience designing and manufacturing products with the current “state-of-the-art” CAD and knows the pain points of our target customers. For those who don’t know, Jordan previously designed the first 3D-printed rockets and the world’s largest 3D printers to build those rockets as the co-founder and CTO of Relativity Space. When I started dipping into the world of CAD for Oxide, Jordan is who I kept asking advice of (and annoying with questions) as to which CAD program we should use. All these discussions eventually lead us to start KittyCAD along with Jenna. Jordan’s experience from Relativity Space and Embedded Ventures, alongside Jenna, will be very valuable for KittyCAD.

This company is shaping up to be something spectacular and that all comes from having the right team in place to make it happen! I’ve had a great time getting to work with Jordan, Jenna, and Hannah so far and I can’t wait for what the future holds. There is nothing quite like the joy that comes from building something with people you respect and admire! I think the only thing that can top that is _shipping_ something! Stay tuned for more updates on KittyCAD, this is going to be a wild ride!
