In this tutorial we'll walk through getting started using the KITTYCAD API

### The Litterbox

KittyCAD offers client libraries in Python and other languages, and our "Litterbox" below is our mini in-browser editor for demonstrating with code snippets. Try executing the python STL conversion code below. You should see the 3d-file re-appear on the right-hand side along with logs from the execution.

{/* __PRE-FETCH__: tutorials/getting_started/getting_started */}

<InlineLitterbox path="tutorials/getting_started/getting_started" />

Now try modifying the code and executing it again. As an example, delete the "#" to the left of `"print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):"` and replace `<your-name>` with your first name.

<TabbedEditor
    tabs={[
        {
            title: '',
            range: [0, 0],
            lang: 'py',
            code: `# Try adding your name by changing the text below to \n# print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):`,
        },
    ]}
/>

Then execute. If you came to this tutorial from [Account Onboarding Progress](/account?tab=onboarding_progress) than you'll need to modify and execute the code in order for it to count as completing the second task.

### Executing from your machine

Again we're going to use python as an example, but if you're comfortable with installing libraries for Go, Javascript or Rust, Instructions for installing them can [be found here](/docs/api).

You will need to have Python installed on your machine, this will depend on your operating-system, but instructions can be found on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Create a new folder where you'd like to setup your test project, and add three text files.

The first will be called `requirements.txt` and will have the following inside.

<TabbedEditor
    tabs={[
        {
            title: 'requirements.txt',
            range: [0, 0],
            lang: 'py',
            code: `kittycad==0.3.3`,
        },
    ]}
/>

The second will be called `convert.py` and will have the following inside

<TabbedEditor tabs={
    [{
        title:'convert.py',
        range: [0, 0],
        lang: 'py',
        code:`
from kittycad.client import ClientFromEnv
from kittycad.models.file_export_format import FileExportFormat
from kittycad.models.file_import_format import FileImportFormat
from kittycad.models.error import Error
from kittycad.api.file import create_file_conversion_with_base64_helper

# Create a new client with your token parsed from the environment variable:
#   KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN.
client = ClientFromEnv(timeout=500, verify_ssl=True)

# Convert a file from OBJ to STL.
# Read in the contents of the file.
file = open("./cube.obj", "rb")
content = file.read()
file.close()

fc = create_file_conversion_with_base64_helper.sync(
    client=client,
    body=content,
    src_format=FileImportFormat.OBJ_NOMTL,
    output_format=FileExportFormat.STL)

if isinstance(fc, Error) or fc == None:
    raise Exception("There was a problem")

print(f"File conversion id: {fc.id}")
# Try adding your name by changing the text below to
# "File conversion status for <your-name>":
print(f"File conversion status: {fc.status}")

output_file_path = "./output.stl"
print(f"Saving output to {output_file_path}")
output_file = open(output_file_path, "wb")
output_file.write(fc.output)
output_file.close()
`
}]
} />

Lastly we'll add a very basic `.obj` file called `cube.obj` and add the following contents

<TabbedEditor tabs={
    [{
        title:'cube.obj',
        range: [0, 0],
        lang: 'py',
        code:`

}]
} />

Then open a PowerShell or Bash terminal depending on your operating-system and navigate to the folder you recently created and run the following:

<Token>
    {(token, platform) =>
        [
            platform === 'windows'
                ? `$env:KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN = '${token}'`
                : `export KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN="${token}"`,
            'pip3 install virtualenv',
            'python3 -m venv venv',
            platform === 'windows'
                ? 'venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1'
                : 'source venv/bin/activate',
            'pip3 install -r requirements.txt',
            'python3 convert.py',
        ].join('\n')
    }
</Token>

You should see the following message printed in your terminal:

```
File conversion id: <your-conversion-id>
File conversion status: Completed
Saving output to ./output.stl
```

Note that the `python3` command might differ depending on what version you've got installed.

Well done, you've completed all of the [onboarding](/account?tab=onboarding_progress). Have a look around the other [tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and [docs](/docs).
