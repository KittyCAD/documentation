### General

{/* START-EXCERPT */}

-   Guess what? Our team üê± just doubled in size! That's right, we've got twice the brainpower üß†, twice the creativity ü¶æ, and twice the fun ‚ú® around here. We're stoked to have them on board, working hard to make our products even better for you.

### Some Sneak Peeks of What's in Work

-   We've got some seriously awesome stuff planned for later this year that we can't wait to share with you! But for now, we're heads down working hard to make it even more amazing. ü§ì
-   We're talking lots of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, lots of brainstorming ‚õàÔ∏è, and lots of collaboration üèãÔ∏è to make sure we knock it out of the park. With all the constant tweaking, perfecting everything, and listening to your feedback, we want to make sure we deliver the best experience possible.
-   So hang tight, we'll have more updates for you soon - and trust us, it's gonna be worth the wait!

### Minor Changes

-   On the website, it's now easier to swap between client libraries in the docs and copy snippets
-   The litterbox and tutorials have now been separated
    -   [Litterbox](https://kittycad.io/docs/samples/convert_file) is now officially its own samples section - play around with the code, live!
