### General

{/* START-EXCERPT */}

-   We joined the [Khronos group and the Metaverse Standards forum](https://kittycad.io/blog/2022-year-in-review#company)!
-   Maybe you saw us on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/sponsors)? KittyCAD - Graphics, Rust, C++ hackers get in touch - we're always hiring!
-   We've open-sourced our [documentation](https://github.com/kittyCAD/documentation) - have any edits, translations, or word recommendations? feel free to open a pr!
-   Did you find our [litterbox page](https://kittycad.io/docs/litterbox/convert_file) yet? Though we won't be building out an app, this is a great place to try out and play around with the api on the fly 🐱 - more samples will be added there soon as well!
