### What's New (`Beta`)

> _What's new around the block. aka the cool toys now available to play with ~_

-   We now have a TypeScript Client! - ([docs](https://docs.kittycad.io/api/authentication?lang=typescript), [lib](https://github.com/KittyCAD/kittycad.ts)).
-   [Unit conversions galore](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/unit). We got conversions for ya temperatures, we got conversions for ya lengths, we got conversions for ya forces and even conversions for ya pressures. Conversions, conversions, everywhere! 🔢
-   [Physics Constants](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/constant). Need a handy-dandy value for your calculation? Now you have it 🧮 ~
    -   (Note this is a `GET` endpoint - 😉 you know what that means for [billing](https://kittycad.io/docs/billing#important-info))
-   [Surface Area](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/file/get-cad-file-surface-area) endpoint calculation, aka how much wrapping paper do you need to wrap that present box 🎁
-   [Center of Mass](https://kittycad.io/dos/api/file/get-cad-file-center-of-mass) endpoint calculation, for all you jenga balancing experts out there 🧐
-   ~New 2D Vector File Conversions for your svg and dxf nightmares 🎃~
    -   this is done as part of a split into 3 endpoint possibilities; the original generic [file_convert](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/file/convert-cad-file-with-defaults) or if you'd like to be specific ~[file_convert for 3d files](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/convert-2d-vector-file), and [file_convert for 2d vector files](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/convert-2d-vector-file)~ (deprecated since publication)

### What's Been Updated

-   ~[More Metric Unit Conversions](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/unit). Added more metric conversions ([general](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/convert-metric-units), [squared](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/convert-metric-squared-units), [cubed](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/convert-metric-cubed-units)) to help on top of any unit conversions you're working through 🔢~ (deprecated since publication)
