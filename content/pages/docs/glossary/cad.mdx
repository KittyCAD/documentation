CAD (Computer Aided Design) is computer software that is used to create 2D and 3D models. CAD is used in many industries, including architecture, engineering, and manufacturing. CAD allows engineers to design, simulate, and analyze their products before they are built. Similar to how you can erase and edit a document on a computer, CAD allows engineers to edit and modify their designs.
