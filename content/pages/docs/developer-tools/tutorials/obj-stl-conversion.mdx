The sample code below reads an OBJ file and passes it to our API telling the API
to convert it to STL format.

The sample below assumes you have exported your API token as an environment
variable like so.

```
export ZOO_API_TOKEN="YOUR-API-TOKEN"
```

<TokenReplacementNote />

Below is our API-client code:

```py data-file="public/litterbox_assets/tutorials/conversion_obj_stl/conversion_obj_stl.py"
```

```
