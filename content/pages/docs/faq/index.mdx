---

### General

<details>
  <summary>What is Zoo?</summary>

    Zoo is an infrastructure company that is building a platform for the future of design and manufacturing. Check out our current products: [Text-to-CAD](https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad), the [Zoo Modeling App](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app), and the [CAD Diff Viewer](https://zoo.dev/diff-viewer).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does payment work for using the Zoo API?</summary>

    Our APIs and tools have pay-as-you-go pricing. You get 40 free minutes of API access per month, followed by a cost of $0.50 per minute for additional usage. When you make a POST api call, you are paying for the server time it took to complete that request. You can find more information on our pricing [here](https://zoo.dev/pricing).

</details>

### Text-to-CAD

<details>
  <summary>What is Text-to-CAD?</summary>

    [Text-to-CAD](https://text-to-cad.zoo.dev/dashboard) is a powerful tool that allows you to convert text-based descriptions of 3D objects into CAD models. This API is built on top of the [ML-ephant API](https://zoo.dev/machine-learning-api)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much does it cost to use the ML-ephant API?</summary>

    The ML-ephant API follows the same pricing model as any other API. You get 40 free minutes of API access per month, followed by a cost of $0.50 per minute for additional usage. When you make a POST API call, you are paying for the server time it took to complete that request. You can find more information on our pricing [here](https://zoo.dev/pricing).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use the CAD generations in other CAD software?</summary>

    If you are used to working with traditional CAD software, you can use the CAD models generated by the Text-to-CAD API in your software. Once your CAD generation is done, you can export a STEP file (or whichever format works best for you) to import into any CAD software you are comfortable with.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What formats can I export to?</summary>

    Currently, we support exporting to STEP, STL, OBJ, GLTF, GLB, FBX, and PLY.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where can I start using the ML-ephant API?</summary>

    Our AI API can be found [here in our documentation](https://zoo.dev/docs/developer-tools/api/ai?lang=python). If you would like assistance getting started, we also created a [tutorial to create your own Text-to-CAD API call](https://zoo.dev/docs/tutorials/text-to-cad).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is Text-to-CAD open source?</summary>

    Our Text-to-CAD UI is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/KittyCAD/text-to-cad-ui). The underlying machine learning model is not open source.

</details>

### Zoo Modeling App

<details>
    <summary>What is the Zoo Modeling App?</summary>

    The Zoo Modeling App (ZMA) is an open-source CAD modeling software that blends the power of code-CAD applications with traditional CAD software workstlyles. ZMA is built on top of the [KittyCAD Geometry Engine](https://zoo.dev/geometry-engine).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need a License to use the Zoo Modeling App? </summary>

    No, you do not need a license like traditional CAD software. To use the Zoo Modeling App, simply visit our [download page](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app/download) and download the appropriate application for your OS. Start modeling right now.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>How do I install the Zoo Modeling App?</summary>
    
    To install the Zoo Modeling App, visit our [download page](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app/download) and download the appropriate application for your OS. Once downloaded, click on the download file and install the application.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>How do I uninstall the Zoo Modeling App?</summary>
    
    To uninstall the Modeling App, simply delete the application from your computer. If you are on Windows, you can uninstall the application from the Control Panel.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>How do I update the Zoo Modeling App?</summary>
    
    If you already have the Modeling App downloaded on your computer, you should be prompted the next time you open the application to update to the newest version. If you do not get prompted, visit the [download page](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app/download) and download the newest version of the Zoo Modeling App. This will overwrite the old version.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>What features will be added?</summary>
    
    You can find our roadmap [here](https://github.com/KittyCAD/modeling-app/issues/729). These are the necessary features to achieve v1.0.0.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>How can I start building my own modeling app?</summary>
    
    You can start using our design API at any time. We have created a [starter tutorial](https://zoo.dev/docs/tutorials/websocket-tutorial).

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Is the Zoo Modeling App open source?</summary>
    
    Yes, the Zoo Modeling App is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/KittyCAD/modeling-app).

</details>

<details>

    <summary>Is the KittyCAD Geometry Engine open source?</summary>

    The geometry engine is not open source. However, you can use the API to create your own modeling app. You can find the API docs [here](https://zoo.dev/docs/developer-tools/api/modeling).
