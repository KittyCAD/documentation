## Introduction

Text-to-CAD is a generative AI feature that allows you to create fully editable 3D
[B-Rep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation) models from text prompts.

## Usage tips

We recommend that users read the following before using Text-to-CAD:

-   We support a maximum prompt length of a few thousand words. Longer prompts take longer to
    respond.
-   Shorter prompts, 1-2 sentences in length, succeed more often than longer prompts.
-   If your prompt omits important dimensions, Text-to-CAD will make its best guess to fill in
    missing details based on industry standards.
-   Traditional, simple mechanical parts work best right now: fasteners, bearings, connectors, etc.
-   Text-to-CAD returns an error if it fails to generate a valid geometry internally, even if it
    understands your prompt. We're working on reducing the amount of errors. You can always try
    again.
-   The same prompt can generate different results when submitted multiple times. Sometimes a
    failing prompt will succeed on the next attempt, and vice versa.

The following video provides a quick overview of how to use Text-to-CAD:

<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
        <iframe
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yugPWyrE_AE"
            allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
            mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"
            msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen"
            oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen"
            webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
            }}
