## Introduction

Zoo Design Studio is a unified CAD suite for engineering and manufacturing companies.
Like traditional CAD applications, Zoo Design Studio allows users to create and edit 3D
models of parts and assemblies.

However, unlike traditional CAD applications, Zoo Design Studio offers more than one approach
to geometry creation. It also includes **Text-to-CAD**, a feature that enables design
engineers to leverage the power of generative AI to create complex designs in seconds.

By supporting traditional point-and-click interactions, programmatic
geometry creation with code, and text prompt interactions via Text-to-CAD, Zoo Design Studio
allows users to flexibly weave edits to their designs between these three approaches.

Zoo Design Studio is built using a proprietary geometry engine, and is GPU-based,
cloud-implemented, API-accessible, and dynamically scalable.
