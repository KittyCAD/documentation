More in depth information is provided below, but if you're keen to get started with Zoo, we
recommend you first take the time to watch this video:

## Getting started

Every time you launch Zoo Design Studio, you will be greeted by a project dashboard. This is your
starting point for creating and managing your design projects.

When you launch Zoo Design Studio for the fisrt time, this dashboard will be empty. To get started,
click _Create Project_, enter a name, and press _Enter_ to open a blank scene. Alternatively, select
_Generate with Text-to-CAD_ to create a model from a prompt (one credit per prompt; free plans
include 40 credits/month) or _Create from Sample_ to open a pre-built part.

## Settings and preferences

To adjust your settings, click the _Settings_ button that's available from the main menu, and
indicated by the gear icon. This will allow you to configure:

-   _Project directory_: where your projects are saved on your computer.
-   _Telemetry_: whether or not to send metadata to Zoo that will help us improve the product.
-   _Keyboard shortcuts_: keyboard shortcuts for various commands.
-   _Machine API server discovery_: a service which locates 3D printers on your local network to
    allow printing direct from Zoo Design Studio.
-   _Version_ information: the version of Zoo Design Studio you are currently using.

You can also adjust your preferences for model navigation mode, theme, and units of measurement.

This video provides a more in-depth overview of the settings and preferences available in Zoo Design
Studio:

            oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen"
            webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
            }}
        />
    </div>

## Sketch basics

To begin creating geometry, open a project and click the _Start Sketch_ button. This will prompt you
for a plane on which to sketch, and then you will enter 2D sketching mode. This will allow you to:

-   Draw geometric elements such as lines, arcs, and circles on the active workplane.
-   Add dimensions and constraints to control the size, shape, and position of your geometry.
-   Use the sketch toolbar to access common operations like mirror.
-   When finished, click _Exit Sketch_ and select a 3D feature such as _Extrude_, _Revolve_, or
    _Sweep_ from the feature toolbar to create a solid model.

            allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
            mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"
            msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen"
            oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen"
            webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
            }}
        />
    </div>
</div>

## KCL basics

Zoo Design Studio uses a custom programming language, KCL, for geometry creation. When you use the
graphical user interface to create geometry by sketching and extruding, our system generates KCL.
However, you can also write KCL directly, allowing you to create complex models using commands and
functions. We also store your KCL code in text files with `.kcl` extension—so we refer to these as
KCL files.

A range of KCL-based sample parts are provided as reference models for use within Zoo Design Studio.
To access these:

-   Click _Create from Sample_ on the project dashboard to browse available KCL examples.
-   Select a sample to clone it into your workspace for examination or modification.
-   Use the feature tree to inspect how the model was constructed.
-   Apply measurement tools to analyze dimensions and geometry.
-   Modify parameters or features as needed to customize the part for your requirements.

<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
        <iframe
            src="https://youtu.be/aoxBIEbUggA"
            allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
            mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"
            msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen"
            oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen"
            webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                width: '100%',
                height: '100%',
            }}
        />
    </div>
</div>

## Importing and exporting files

Zoo Design Studio supports various file formats for interoperability with other CAD systems:

-   _Importing_: Add external models to your project by either dragging and dropping files directly
    into the workspace or selecting _File → Import_ from the menu. Supported formats include STEP,
    IGES, and STL.
-   _Exporting_: Save your designs for use in other applications by choosing _File → Export_ and
    selecting your desired format: `STEP`, `STL`, `gLTF`, `OBJ`, or `PLY`.
-   For models created with the Text-to-CAD feature, your generated geometry is automatically saved
    in the project folder and can be exported to any supported format at any time.
