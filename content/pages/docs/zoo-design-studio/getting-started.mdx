## Getting started

In the video below, we'll walk through the basics, including how to create an account, log in, choose between the desktop and browser version, and configure your settings. By the end, you'll know where to start, how to pick the right environment for your workflow, and how to set up Zoo Design Studio so you're ready to begin designing.

## Creating a new project

In the video below, we’ll show you how to create a new, empty project in Zoo Design Studio and start designing from scratch. We’ll also walk through how to explore and use sample projects if you’d prefer a starting point you can inspect, modify, and build on. By the end, you’ll know how to choose the right way to begin, whether you want a blank canvas or an example to work from.

## Desktop vs browser version

This video explains the differences between the Zoo Design Studio desktop app and the browser-based experience. We’ll walk through what works in each, what’s available only on desktop, and when it makes sense to use the browser for quick exploration. By the end, you’ll know which option is right for your workflow and when to switch between them.

## Zookeeper basics

In this video, we introduce Zookeeper’s core capabilities and show how to work with it effectively. You’ll learn how to ask Zookeeper for actions, explanations, and guidance, and how to use conversation to explore designs, make changes, and understand design decisions. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation for using Zookeeper as part of your design workflow.

## Sketch basics

To begin creating geometry, open a project. Before starting your sketch, ensure your desired units (e.g., mm, inches) are set.
Once ready, click the Start Sketch button. This will prompt you for a plane on which to sketch, and then you will enter 2D sketching mode. This will allow you to:

-   Draw geometric elements such as lines, arcs, and circles on the active workplane.
-   Add dimensions and constraints to control the size, shape, and position of your geometry. Dimensions can also be based on parameters and formulas, allowing for powerful parametric design.

When finished, click Exit Sketch and select a 3D feature such as Extrude, Revolve, or Sweep from the feature toolbar to create a solid model.

**Important Note on Creating Holes**: For features like holes within a solid, it's generally best practice to extrude the main shape first. Then, create a new sketch on a face of that solid for the hole's profile, and use a cutting feature (e.g., an extrude-cut, or a Boolean subtract). Sketching a circle inside another closed profile on the same initial sketch may not automatically result in a hole when extruded.

## KCL basics

Zoo Design Studio uses a custom programming language, KCL, for geometry creation. When you use point-and-click or Zookeeper to create geometry by sketching and extruding, our system generates KCL. However, you can also write KCL directly, allowing you to create complex models using commands and functions. We also store your KCL code in text files with .kcl extension—so we refer to these as KCL files.

While you can achieve a lot with the point-and-click, directly editing or writing KCL unlocks advanced capabilities. This includes creating complex parametric models, automating design tasks through scripting, and defining geometries that might be challenging with GUI tools alone. It also makes Zoo designs highly portable and readily version-controllable with tools such as [git](https://git-scm.com/).

A range of KCL-based sample parts are provided as reference models for use within Zoo Design Studio. To access these:

Click Create from Sample on the project dashboard to browse available KCL examples or read the [KCL book](https://zoo.dev/docs/kcl-book/intro.html).

## Importing and exporting files

Zoo Design Studio supports various file formats for interoperability with other CAD systems:

-   **Importing**: Add external models to your project by selecting Insert from the top command bar. Supported formats include `STEP`, `.sldprt` and `STL`. For further details see the [KCL docs](https://zoo.dev/docs/kcl-lang/foreign-imports).
-   **Exporting**: Save your designs for use in other applications by choosing File → Export and selecting your desired format: `STEP`, `STL`, `gLTF`, `OBJ`, or `PLY`.
-   For models created with Zookeeper, your generated geometry is automatically saved in the project folder and can be exported to any supported format at any time.
