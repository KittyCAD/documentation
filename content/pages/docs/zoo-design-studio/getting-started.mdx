## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with Zoo Design Studio, and is intended for first-time users.
It covers the following topics:

-   [Getting started](#getting-started)
-   [Settings and preferences](#settings-and-preferences)
-   [Sketch basics](#sketch-basics)
-   [KCL basics](#kcl-basics)
-   [Importing and exporting files](#importing-and-exporting-files)

## Getting started

Every time you launch Zoo Design Studio, you will be greeted by a project dashboard. This is your
starting point for creating and managing your design projects.

When you launch Zoo Design Studio for the fisrt time, this dashboard will be empty. To get started,
click _Create Project_, enter a name, and press _Enter_ to open a blank scene. Alternatively, select
_Generate with Text‑to‑CAD_ to create a model from a prompt (one credit per prompt; free plans
include 40 credits/month) or _Create from Sample_ to open a pre‑built part.

## Settings and preferences

To adjust your settings, click the _Settings_ button that's available from the main menu, and
indicated by the gear icon. This will allow you to configure:

-   _Project directory_: where your projects are saved on your computer.
-   _Telemetry_: whether or not to send metadata to Zoo that will help us improve the product.
-   _Keyboard shortcuts_: keyboard shortcuts for various commands.
-   _Machine API server discovery_: a service which locates 3D printers on your local network to
    allow printing direct from Zoo Design Studio.
-   _Version_ information: the version of Zoo Design Studio you are currently using.

## Sketch basics

Inside a project, press _Start Sketch_ to enter 2D mode. Core operations:

-   Draw lines, arcs, and splines on the workplane.
-   Apply dimensions and constraints for precise control.
-   Finish the sketch, then apply 3D features such as _Extrude_, _Revolve_, or _Sweep_ from the
    toolbar.

## KCL basics

KCL parts are provided as reference models. Use _Create from Sample_ on the home screen to clone one
into your workspace. You can inspect features, measure geometry, or modify the part as needed.

## Importing and exporting files

-   _Import_: drag‑and‑drop or use _File → Import_ to bring in STEP, IGES, or STL files.
-   _Export_: choose _File → Export_ to generate STEP, IGES, STL, or native ZDS formats.
-   For Text‑to‑CAD projects, the generated model is saved automatically in the project folder and
    can be exported at any time.
