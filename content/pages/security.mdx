excerpt: 'Information about how Zoo secures its products.'
---

Zoo is committed to delivering high-quality and secure software and services to our customers.
We maintain internal information security policies and procedures aligned with controls and best practices from the AICPA SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria.
Our current SOC 2 Type II report can be reviewed in our [Trust Center](https://trust.zoo.dev/).

This document outlines the key processes and controls Zoo.dev has implemented to protect customer data. Any policies that specifically apply to Zoo.dev's platform services are noted where relevant.

Visit the Trust Center [here](https://trust.zoo.dev).

## 1\. Responsible Disclosure Policy

We encourage security researchers and members of the community to report any identified vulnerabilities through the outlined process, so that we can promptly investigate and remediate any issues.

- If you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in Zoo, review our [security policy](https://github.com/KittyCAD/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and afterwards report the bug through the process described there.  
- If your issue is not security-related, please reach out via our [community support forum](https://community.zoo.dev/).

Refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/KittyCAD/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to learn how to get in contact with us for general security inquiries.

We're incredibly grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to us. All reports are thoroughly investigated.

## 2\. Security Controls Framework

Zoo follows internal processes and policies designed to protect customer data and related assets against threats to security and availability.
Our security controls are aligned with the AICPA SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for security (common criteria). Our current SOC 2 Type II report can be reviewed in our [Trust Center](https://trust.zoo.dev/).

## 3\. Customer Data Access

Zoo stores customer data in a globally distributed Cockroach Labs cluster. Production services are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A selected number of Zoo employees have access to production systems for maintenance and support purposes.

Zoo is designed to keep the data stored minimal. Manually designed CAD files created using the Zoo Design Studio are not persisted in Zoo's systems, but rather in the users' local file system.

If training is enabled, Text-to-CAD responses may be stored in Zoo's systems for the purpose of improving the model. Depending on the tier, customers may opt out manually, or have been opted out by default.

Customers can delete their data at any time using the zoo.dev website.

## 4\. Authentication

Zoo does not use passwords for authentication. Instead, we make use of SSO via OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect and email authentication flows.

For enterprise customers we offer SAML 2.0 to further protect user accounts. SAML authentication works on top of the regular authentication.

Organizations offer customers the ability to manage their users and permissions.

## 5\. Physical Security

Zoo's platform infrastructure is hosted on cloud environments provided by CockroachLabs, AWS, and GCP. We inherit the physical security controls of our data centers.

Zoo's corporate offices do not host any customer compute or storage infrastructure. Access to corporate offices is limited to employees, contractors, and authorized vendors.

## 6\. Corporate Security

Zoo's internal security program holistically incorporates controls across endpoint protection, malware prevention, vulnerability management, staff training, third-party risk management, and policy governance in order to meet our strict standards.

## 7\. Encryption of Customer Data

All data transmitted between Zoo clients and backend services is encrypted using TLS. Zoo enforces TLS 1.2 or higher for all communications over public networks, with TLS 1.3 used where supported. TLS encryption is required and enforced and requires no customer-side configuration.

Data at rest is encrypted using the cloud provider's native infrastructure-level disk encryption.

## 8\. Incident Response Management

Zoo has defined processes for identifying and managing security vulnerabilities, threats, and unauthorized access. When a security incident is suspected, appropriate personnel are immediately assigned to investigate, assess impact, contain, mitigate, and recover from the incident.

## 9\. Business Continuity

Zoo maintains a Business Continuity Plan to ensure service reliability in the event of a disruption. All customer data is hosted on cloud infrastructure. Our application infrastructure is designed for high availability and leverages data replication across multiple availability zones, depending on the customer's selected deployment.

In the event that Zoo's corporate offices become unavailable, customer services remain unaffected. Day-to-day support operations are not dependent on any single physical location. Zoo employees are primarily working remotely, and business continuity is tested on an annual basis.

## 10\. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Zoo's software development lifecycle emphasizes secure design, development, and deployment. It begins with clear requirements gathering and collaboration, followed by adherence to secure coding practices, change reviews, and comprehensive testing before changes are deployed.

Our source code is continuously scanned for vulnerabilities, including those related to third-party dependencies.

Zoo regularly performs version updates and security patching for its cloud-based platform. Critical updates to Zoo products are communicated to customers after deployment.

Our infrastructure, API, and software are reviewed annually by an independent third-party security firm. Security reviews are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/KittyCAD/audits).

Zoo also deploys a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## 11\. Customer Responsibilities

Zoo is built with shared responsibility in mind. Customers are expected to implement appropriate controls within their organization to complement the security of the service. These responsibilities include:

- Managing user accounts, credentials (e.g. API keys), and permissions for the Zoo platform.  
- Identifying authorized points of contact to coordinate with Zoo support.  
- Notifying Zoo of any suspected security incidents in a timely manner.
