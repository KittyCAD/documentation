Zoo is built with security in mind from the ground up. We care deeply about
the security of our product and our customer's information.

The below information is meant for any security researcher who might find
a vulnerability in the security of our product.

## Bounties

We _will_ pay bounties for the following types of vulnerabilities if a reasearcher
can show a proof of concept that does the following:

- Obtaining write access to any of our code source repositories.
- Obtaining read access to any of our private source code repositories.
- Obtaining access to our private network/infrastructure.
- Obtaining access to our databases.

We _will not_ pay for the following:

    one of the following vulnerabilities above.

### Rules

- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
- Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
- When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
- Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
- Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of live user production services. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.
- Please limit security scanner QPS against Zoo domains to 5 QPS
