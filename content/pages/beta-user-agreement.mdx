This Beta Tester Agreement (this "**Beta Agreement**") is entered into between
Zoo, Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("Zoo"), and you ("**You**"). This Beta
Tester Agreement governs your access to and use of certain software and related
services (the "**Beta Services**") offered by Zoo solely for testing and
evaluation purposes. Further description and related details of the Beta
Services may be provided to you at the time you access or engage with the Beta
Services. By accessing or using the Beta Services, you agree to be bound by this
Beta Agreement and accept all of its terms. If you do not accept all the terms
of this Beta Agreement, then you may not use the Beta Services.

1. <u>Terms of Use.</u> You acknowledge and agree that your access and use of the Beta
   Services will be subject to the Zoo’s terms of use (accessible at
   [zoo.dev/terms-and-conditions](https://zoo.dev/terms-and-conditions))
   ("**ToU**") and Privacy Policy (accessible at
   [zoo.dev/privacy-policy](https://zoo.dev/privacy-policy)) ("**Privacy
   Policy**"), both of which are incorporated herein by reference, and the Beta
   Services are part of the Services (as such term is defined in the ToU) for
   purposes of the ToU and Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict between the
   terms of this Beta Agreement and any terms of the ToU, this Beta Agreement
   supersedes the ToU with respect to your access to and use of the Beta Services.

2. <u>Acknowledgment of Beta Services Limitations.</u> You acknowledge that: (a) the Beta
   Services have not been made commercially available by Zoo; (b) the Beta
   Services may not operate properly, be in final form or fully functional; (c) the
   Beta Services may contain errors, design flaws or other problems; (d) it may not
   be possible to make the Beta Services fully functional; (e) use of the Beta
   Services may result in unexpected results, corruption or loss of data, or other
   unpredictable damage or loss; and (f) Zoo has no obligation to release
   a commercial version of the Beta Services or otherwise introduce the Beta
   Services. You assume all risk arising from use of the Beta Services as further
   stated in this Beta Agreement.

3. <u>Obligations under Third Party Agreements.</u> If you have obligations to any third
   party, such as under the terms, conditions or policies of a telecommunication
   services provider that you use or through which you purchase data services (as
   a non-limiting example), you, and not Zoo, are solely responsible for your
   compliance with those requirements. By providing you with access to the Beta
   Services, Zoo does not warrant or guarantee that how you may choose to use
   the Beta Services is allowed by any particular service provider, nor that your
   use complies with any laws or regulations that may apply to your use or purchase
   of any other services. Zoo is not liable for your failure to comply with
   any applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations
   or any contracts, rules, policies or procedures applicable to your activities.

4. <u>License.</u>

    4.1. <u>License Grant.</u> Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this
    Beta Agreement, Zoo hereby grants to you a limited, nonexclusive,
    nontransferable, revocable license, during the Term of this Beta Agreement, to
    access and use the Beta Services solely for the purposes of testing and
    evaluation, and not for general production or commercial use.

    4.2. <u>Restrictions.</u> You acknowledge that the Beta Services contain trade secrets of
    Zoo and its licensors, and, in order to protect such trade secrets and
    other interests that Zoo and its licensors may have in the Beta Services,
    you agree not to: (i) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Beta
    Services or authorize a third party to do any of the foregoing, (ii) modify the
    Beta Services, (iii) distribute sell, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Beta
    Services, or (iv) copy the Beta Services, except as strictly necessary to use
    the Beta Services in accordance with the terms of Section 4.1.

5. <u>Feedback.</u> You agree to (a) test the Beta Services and cooperate with Zoo in
   evaluating the Beta Services, and (b) provide Zoo with feedback as
   reasonably requested from time to time. All feedback, comments, and suggestions
   for improvements that you provide to Zoo hereunder are referred to
   collectively as "**Feedback**". You hereby grant Zoo a non-exclusive,
   worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and
   transferable license under any and all intellectual property rights that you own
   or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and
   otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.

6. <u>Ownership.</u> As between the parties, Zoo is the sole owner of all rights,
   title and interest in and to the Beta Services, including all intellectual
   property rights therein. You will not acquire any rights or licenses in the Beta
   Services or Zoo’s Confidential Information, except as expressly provided in
   Section 4.1 this Beta Agreement.

7. <u>Confidentiality.</u>

    7.1. For purposes of this Beta Agreement, "**Confidential Information**" means the Beta
    Services and any information or materials disclosed by or on behalf of Zoo
    to you that (a) is marked "confidential" or "proprietary" or with a similar
    designation at the time of such disclosure, or (b) due to its nature or the
    circumstances of its disclosure, a person exercising reasonable business
    judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary. You agree: (i) to
    maintain all Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not to disclose
    Confidential Information to any third parties; and (iii) not to use any
    Confidential Information for any purpose except for the purpose of testing and
    evaluating the Beta Services in accordance with this Beta Agreement and the ToU.

    7.2. The obligations and restrictions in Section 7.1 will not apply to any
    information or materials that: (a) were, at the date of disclosure, or have
    subsequently become, generally known or available to the public through no act
    or failure to act by you; (b) were rightfully known by you prior to the
    disclosure of such information or materials from Zoo; (c) are rightfully
    acquired by you from a third party who has the right to disclose such
    information or materials without breach of any obligation of confidentiality or
    restricted use to Zoo; or (d) are independently developed by you without
    access to any Confidential Information.

    7.3. Upon termination of this Beta Agreement, or earlier upon Zoo’s request, you
    will promptly return to Zoo, or, at Zoo’s option, destroy, all
    tangible items and embodiments containing or consisting of Confidential
    Information and all copies thereof. All Confidential Information remains the
    sole and exclusive property of Zoo.

    7.4. You agree that any breach of this Beta Agreement by you may result in
    irreparable harm to Zoo, for which damages would be an inadequate remedy
    and therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at
    law, Zoo shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction,
    in the event of such breach.

8. <u>Termination.</u> Zoo reserves the right to modify or terminate the Beta
   Services, this Beta Agreement, or your use of the Beta Services, or to limit or
   deny access to the Beta Services, at any time, in its sole discretion, for any
   reason, with or without notice and without liability to you. You may discontinue
   your use of the Beta Services at any time. Upon any termination, discontinuation
   or cancellation of the Beta Services, this Beta Agreement or your access, the
   following sections of this Beta Agreement will survive: 2, 3, 4.2, 5, 6, 7, 9,
   10 and 11.

9. <u>Warranty Disclaimers.</u> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BETA SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED
   "AS IS." ZOO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
   NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE
   OF TRADE. ZOO MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT ANY OF THE BETA SERVICES WILL MEET
   YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND/OR THAT THE BETA SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY OR

   OF THE BETA SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY
   RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND/OR LOSS OF DATA THAT
   RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL AND/OR DATA.

10. <u>Limitation on Liability.</u> IN NO EVENT WILL ZOO BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY
    THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE,
    DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BETA
    AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE BETA SERVICES OR
    FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE BETA SERVICES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM
    ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT

    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE
    LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS
    BETA AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ZOO’S LIABILITY HEREUNDER IS LIMITED TO
    $50.00.

11. <u>Miscellaneous.</u> This Beta Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance
    with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
    provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action related to this
    Beta Agreement will be the state and federal courts located in the San
    Francisco, California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to
    jurisdiction and venue in such courts. This Beta Agreement, together with the
    ToU and Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and
    agreement between Zoo and you with respect to its subject matter, and
    supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or
    agreements between Zoo and you with respect to its subject matter. If for
    any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Beta
    Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
    maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Beta Agreement will
    remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer this Beta
    Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without Zoo’s prior written
    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Beta Agreement, without
    such consent, will be null and of no effect. Zoo may freely assign or
    transfer this Beta Agreement without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this
    Beta Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their
    successors and permitted assigns. Zoo’s failure to enforce any right or
    provision of this Beta Agreement will not be considered a waiver of those
    rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in
    writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Zoo. Except as
    expressly set forth in this Beta Agreement, the exercise by either party of any
    of its remedies under this Beta Agreement will be without prejudice to its other
    remedies under this Beta Agreement or otherwise.
