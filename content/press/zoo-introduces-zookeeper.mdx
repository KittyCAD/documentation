Zoo, a company that creates infrastructure for hardware design, today announced the launch of Zookeeper, a conversational design agent that helps engineers move from intent to fully editable CAD models through natural language interaction. With Zookeeper, users can describe what they want to design, ask questions, explore alternatives, and iterate on existing designs, all within Zoo Design Studio.

Zookeeper captures a user’s design intent, conducts relevant research, proposes constraints and parameters, and generates a clear design plan before producing a CAD model. The resulting model is fully editable using the same constraint-driven sketching, and feature tree workflows engineers already rely on. Zookeeper builds directly on Zoo’s existing Text-to-CAD capabilities, extending them into a reasoning-driven, conversational experience.

“Zookeeper is about meeting engineers where they are,” said Jessie Frazelle, CEO and Co-Founder of Zoo. “Some people want to type a prompt and move fast. Others want fine-grained control through constraints and sketches. Zookeeper supports both, acting as a collaborator that can reason through a problem, explain tradeoffs, and generate designs within an engineer's native environment.”

Other AI-driven design tools that operate as black boxes, Zookeeper produces transparent, structured outputs within the traditional CAD environment. It proposes explicit constraints, parameters, and references, and represents designs through a clear, inspectable feature tree. Engineers can modify designs manually, programmatically, or conversationally, with changes reflected consistently across all interfaces.

“Zookeeper doesn’t replace the tools engineers already trust,” said Jordan Noone, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of Zoo. “It amplifies them. You can ask it to design a part from scratch, iterate on an existing model, or simply explain how something works. Delegating design tasks leverages an engineer’s time, allowing them to focus on the most valuable creative work. ”

Zookeeper is available within Zoo Design Studio and leverages Zoo’s proprietary geometry engine, which enables scalable, cloud-native CAD workflows. The agent is accessible within Zoo’s ML-ephant Machine Learning API, and works alongside Zoo’s KittyCAD Design API and, allowing developers and companies to integrate conversational design capabilities into their own applications.

### ABOUT ZOO

Zoo develops modern tools for hardware design, including first-of-their-kind generative AI capabilities for CAD. Its flagship product is Zoo Design Studio, modeling software that serves as the central hub of a broader CAD ecosystem which includes innovative tools like Text-to-CAD and a suite of enterprise-ready CAD APIs for developers. Zoo's products are built using its proprietary geometry engine, which serves as a digital bridge between hardware development and machine learning frameworks. It is the first to be GPU-based, cloud-implemented, API-accessible, and dynamically scalable.

Zoo was incubated within Embedded Ventures with additional investors including Venrex Partners, Adventure Fund, Alan Rutledge, Chestnut Street Ventures, Andrew Cote, Anomaly Fund, Autopilot Fund, Bernie Lagrange, Carl Bass, Ex Nihilo, Gaingels, Jude Gomila, Kelvin Beachum, Liquid 2, Madrona, Matt Terrell, Nat Friedman, Quantonation, Preston-Werner Ventures, Undeterred Capital, Unpopular Ventures and USC's Viterbi School of Engineering. Zoo is led by co-founders Jessie Frazelle, Jordan Noone, and Jenna Bryant.
