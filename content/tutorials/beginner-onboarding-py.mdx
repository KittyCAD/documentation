title: 'Python Beginner Tutorial'
excerpt: In this tutorial we'll walk through the basics of Zoo and using the API
---

Welcome to Zoo. We are building tools to be the backbone infrastructure for hardware tools. 

Welcome to our Python beginner tutorial. This is primarily for those that have little coding experience, have no idea what an API is, or have no idea how to use them. 

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. The key to an API is that it allows applications to talk and be used by one another. Here are some current examples of API's used today.
* Uber drivers use Google Maps for navigation in the Uber app.
* Duolingo allows users to log in using their Facebook information.
* Shopify uses Stripe to process credit card payments. 

API's are powerful. Let's take the Uber example above. It would take a lot of time and engineers to develop a map feature similar to Google Maps within the Uber app. Uber uses Google Maps' API to access it within their own app. Of course, Uber pays a portion of their sales to Google in return for using their API. 

## Let's Get Started

For you to communicate with Zoo's website, you must have an API key. When you make an API command, you will pass this API key along with your command, so that we can verify it's you. 

You will see your API token below if you are signed in and have already generated one. If all you see is "Generate your first API token," then you currently do not have a token. Follow the steps below to generate an API key:
* Create an account. If you haven't already, you can [create an account here](/account)
* Sign in. Once you've signed up for an account, make sure you are signed in. 
* Generate an API key. You can either go into your [account settings](/account?tab=api_tokens) to generate an API key, or you can press the button below and we will take care of it for you!

## Executing From Your Computer

* First, we want to make sure you have the right tools to make your first API command from your computer. We will provide you with almost everything you need. There are a few files that you will need to download from the KittyCAD repository:

[Download Here](https://github.com/KittyCAD/litterbox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

The link will have you download a zip file. Place this zip file in an easy-to-access location on your computer (the Desktop is a simple spot). The .zip file contains many files, but there are  two files that we will be working with: a 3D model (dodecahedron.obj) and a python script (convert.py).

* Once you download the .zip file and place it somewhere you can easily access, extract the contents of your zip file. You can do this by double-clicking on the file. This will unpack the zip file and place a new folder called `litterbox-main` with all the contents into your directory. 
* Install the latest version of Python for your machine here: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * **make sure you download the correct version for Mac**
* Once you download Python, you will need to open your **Terminal**. You can open **Terminal** in a few ways:
    * Press "cmd" + "space" and type in "Terminal" and hit "return"
    * Press the magnifying glass icon <img src="/mac-spotlight.png" style={{ width: '20px', height: 'auto'}}/> on the top-right of your screen, type "Terminal" in the search box, and hit "return".
    * Go to your **Applications/Utilities** folder. Double-click **Terminal**
* Once the **Terminal** is open, you will need to navigate to the folder you downloaded. As an example, let's say you put them on the Desktop. You would type the following in your **Terminal** and hit "return":

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/litterbox-main
```

cd stands for change directory. Once you hit "return", you will be working inside the Desktop. For another example, let's say you put your files in a folder called ZooPractice within the Documents folder. This would look like so:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ZooPractice/litterbox-main
```

You will now be working inside the `litterbox-main` folder you placed inside the ZooPractice folder.

Another method for changing directories is if you see the folder you want to move into (whether through Finder or the Desktop), you can type "cd" and then just drag and drop the folder onto **Terminal**, it will automatically fill out the file path for you. Just hit "return". 

* Once inside the correct folder, input the following command into **Terminal**. Simply copy and paste the following

```bash
export KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN="YOUR-API-TOKEN"
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install kittycad
python3 tutorials/beginner_tutorial/convert.py
```

<TokenReplacementNote />

As long as everything went smoothly, you will see the following output (Note: your STL file will be called **output.stl** and be placed in the same directory):

```bash
File conversion id: <your-conversion-id>
File conversion status: Completed
Saving output to ./output.stl
```

**Note:** depending on the version of Python you have installed, the "Python3" command might differ.

Congrats! You just made your first successful API command using a Python script. We offer plenty of API endpoints for you to use (file conversions, calculating center of mass, converting units, and more). Check them out [here](/docs/api).

* Once you download the .zip file and place it somewhere you can easily access, extract the contents of your zip file. You can do this by double-clicking on the file. This will unpack the zip file and place a new folder called `litterbox-main` with all the contents into your directory. 
* Install the latest version of Python for your machine here: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * **make sure you download the correct version for Windows**
    * Note: if you see a checkbox to **Add python [ver] to PATH**, make sure you check this box.
* Once you download Python, you will need to open your **Powershell**. One way to open the **Powershell** is to click on the Start button and type "powershell" and press enter
* Once **Powershell** is open, you will need to navigate to the folder in which you put all the files. As an example, let's say you put them on the Desktop. You would type the following in **Powershell** and hit enter:

```bash
cd $HOME/Desktop/litterbox-main
```

`cd` stands for change directory. Once you hit "return", you will be working inside the Desktop. For another example, let's say you put your files in a folder called ZooPractice within the Documents folder. This would look like so:

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/ZooPractice/litterbox-main
```

You will now be working inside the `litterbox-main` folder you placed inside the ZooPractice folder.

Another method for changing directories is if you see the folder you want to move into (whether through File Explorer or the Desktop), you can type "cd" and then just drag and drop the folder onto **Powershell**, it will automatically fill out the file path for you. Just hit "enter". 

You will now be working inside the folder you created called ZooPractice.
* Once inside the correct folder, input the following commands into **Powershell**. (Note: if you are signed in and have made an API token, we auto-populated your token below). Simply copy and paste the following:

```bash
$env:KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN = "YOUR-API-TOKEN"
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install kittycad
python .\tutorials\beginner_tutorial\convert.py
```
