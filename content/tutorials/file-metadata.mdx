The sample code below reads an OBJ file to get the mass and volume of the object.

export KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN="YOUR-API-TOKEN"
```

Below is our API-client code:

<Tabbed titles={["Python", "Go"]}>
```py data-file="public/litterbox_assets/tutorials/get_mass_volume/get_mass_volume.py"
```
```go data-file="public/litterbox_assets/tutorials/get_mass_volume/get_mass_volume.go"
```
