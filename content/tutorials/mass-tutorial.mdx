This tutorial is a step-by-step walkthrough of using the KittyCAD API to get the mass of a CAD file.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, we need a CAD file to work with. For this tutorial, you can either use your own CAD file or download the <a href="/cad-models/AluminumSupportRail.STEP" download="test.STEP">sample file here</a>. This file is a 2 feet long aluminum support rail. 

### Generate an API Token

For any API call, you have to have a KittyCAD API token. You can either create one down below, or click <a href="https://kittycad.io/account/api-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to navigate to your account page to generate an API token. Once you have your API token, you will use that token for your API calls. **Do not share your API token with anyone.**

(You must be signed in to generate an API token)

### Using CURL

For this next section, we will be using the CURL command for getting the mass of a CAD file. You can find it in the API docs [here](https://kittycad.io/docs/api/file/get-cad-file-mass)

Below is the basic structure of the API call:
```
curl -X POST "https://api.kittycad.io/file/mass" \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token-here>" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
	--data-binary "@path/to/file"
```

Let's break down the CURL command:

- This first line is the API call itself. We are using the `POST` method to send the file to the API endpoint. The endpoint is `https://api.kittycad.io/file/mass`. 
    - We will need to include some parameters in the api call before we can actually use this.
- The next line is the authorization header. This is where you put your API token. Replace `<your-api-token-here>` with your API token.
- The next line is the content type header. This is where you put the content type of the file you are sending. For this tutorial, we are sending a CAD file, so we will use `application/octet-stream`.
- The last line is where you put the file you are sending. Replace `path/to/file` with the path to your CAD file.

#### Required Parameters

This API call has four required parameters:
- material_density
- material_density_unit
- output_unit
- src_format

If you downloaded the sample CAD file, you can use the following parameters:
- material_density: 168.48 (this is the density of aluminum 6061 in lb/ft^3)
- material_density_unit: lb/ft^3
- output_unit: lb
- src_format: step

All required parameters go directly after the API endpoint. You start with a '?' and then input the parameters, separating each one with a '&', like so:
`https://api.kittycad.io/file/mass?material_density=168.48&material_density_unit=lb/ft^3&output_unit=lb&src_format=step`

#### Putting it all together

Finally, you can structure your API call like so (make sure to replace `<your-api-token-here>` with your API token, and `path/to/file` with the path to your CAD file):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.kittycad.io/file/mass?material_density=168.48&material_density_unit=lb/ft^3&output_unit=lb&src_format=step" \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token-here>" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
	--data-binary "@path/to/file" | jq
```

*Note:* the `| jq` at the end of the command is optional. It just formats the response to be easier to read.

### Response

If you did everything correctly, you should get a response that looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "12599bcf-e308-4908-aa7e-8c5b2cd2b529",
  "created_at": "2023-11-29T00:05:21.164208107Z",
  "started_at": "2023-11-29T00:05:21.570700348Z",
  "completed_at": "2023-11-29T00:05:21.596615538Z",
  "user_id": "ab043c5f-8e45-4d1f-abef-4b7de7605591",
  "status": "completed",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-29T00:05:21.164208107Z",
  "src_format": "step",
  "material_density": 168.48,
  "material_density_unit": "lb:ft3",
  "mass": 4.970484108657113,
  "output_unit": "lb"
}
```

So the mass of this aluminum support rail is 4.97 pounds.
