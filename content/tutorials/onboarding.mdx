In this tutorial we'll walk through getting started using the KITTYCAD API

### Getting started

KittyCAD offers client libraries in Python and other languages, and our "Litterbox" below is our mini in-browser editor for demonstrating with code snippets. Try executing the python STL conversion code below. You should see the 3d-file re-appear on the right-hand side along with logs from the execution.

```py data-file="public/litterbox_assets/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started.py"
```

Now try modifying the code and executing it again. As an example, delete the "#" to the left of `"print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):"` and replace `<your-name>` with your first name.

```py
  # Try adding your name by changing the text to
  print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):`,
```

Then execute. If you came to this tutorial from [Account Onboarding Progress](/account?tab=onboarding_progress) than you'll need to modify and execute the code in order for it to count as completing the second task.

### Executing from your machine

Again we're going to use python as an example, but if you're comfortable with installing libraries for Go, Javascript or Rust, instructions for installing them can [be found here](/docs/api).

You will need to have Python installed on your machine, this will depend on your operating-system, but instructions can be found on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Create a new folder where you'd like to setup your test project.

We will create our first file, `convert.py` and will have the following inside:

```py data-file="public/litterbox_assets/tutorials/beginner_tutorial/convert.py"
```

Lastly we'll add a very basic `.obj` file called `cube.obj` and add the following contents:

```obj data-file="public/litterbox_assets/cube.obj"
```

Then open a PowerShell or Bash terminal depending on your operating-system and navigate to the folder you recently created and run the following (replacing `<your-token-here>` with your API token):

```bash 
export KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install kittycad
python3 convert.py
```

You should see the following message printed in your terminal:

```txt
Saving output to ./output.stl
```

Note that the `python3` command might differ depending on what version you've got installed.

Well done, you've completed all of the [onboarding](/account?tab=onboarding_progress). Have a look around the other [tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and [docs](/docs).
