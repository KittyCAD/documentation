In this tutorial we'll walk through getting started using the KITTYCAD API

### The Litterbox

KittyCAD offers client libraries in Python and other languages, and our "Litterbox" below is our mini in-browser editor for demonstrating with code snippets. Try executing the python STL conversion code below. You should see the 3d-file re-appear on the right-hand side along with logs from the execution.

{/* __PRE-FETCH__: tutorials/getting_started/getting_started */}

<InlineLitterbox path="tutorials/getting_started/getting_started" />

Now try modifying the code and executing it again. As an example, delete the "#" to the left of `"print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):"` and replace `<your-name>` with your first name.

<TabbedEditor
    tabs={[
        {
            title: '',
            range: [0, 0],
            lang: 'py',
            code: `# Try adding your name by changing the text below to \n# print(<your-name>, congrats! Your STL conversion was successful):`,
        },
    ]}
/>

Then execute. If you came to this tutorial from [Account Onboarding Progress](/account?tab=onboarding_progress) than you'll need to modify and execute the code in order for it to count as completing the second task.

### Executing from your machine

Again we're going to use python as an example, but if you're comfortable with installing libraries for Go, Javascript or Rust, instructions for installing them can [be found here](/docs/api).

You will need to have Python installed on your machine, this will depend on your operating-system, but instructions can be found on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

Create a new folder where you'd like to setup your test project.

We will create our first file, `convert.py` and will have the following inside:

<TabbedEditor tabs={
    [{
        title:'convert.py',
        range: [0, 0],
        lang: 'py',
        code:`
from typing import Any, List, Optional, Tuple, Union
from kittycad.api.file import create_file_conversion
from kittycad.client import ClientFromEnv
from kittycad.models import Error, FileConversion
from kittycad.models.file_export_format import FileExportFormat
from kittycad.models.file_import_format import FileImportFormat
from kittycad.models.error import Error
from kittycad.types import Unset
from kittycad.models.base64data import Base64Data
from typing import Dict

# Create a new client with your token parsed from the environment variable:
#   KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN.

def convertCubetoSTL():
    client = ClientFromEnv(timeout=500, verify_ssl=True)

    # Convert a file from OBJ to STL.
    # Read in the contents of the file.
    file = open("./cube.obj", "rb")
    content = file.read()
    file.close()

    result: Optional[Union[Error, FileConversion]] = create_file_conversion.sync(
        client=client,
        body=content,
        src_format=FileImportFormat.OBJ,
        output_format=FileExportFormat.STL,
    )

    if isinstance(result, Error) or result == None:
        raise Exception("There was a problem")

    body: FileConversion = result

    if isinstance(body.outputs, Unset):
        raise Exception("Expected outputs to be set")

    outputs: Dict[str, Base64Data] = body.outputs
        
    for _, output in outputs.items():
        output_file_path = "./output.stl"
        print(f"Saving output to {output_file_path}")
        output_file = open(output_file_path, "wb")
        output_file.write(output.get_decoded())
        output_file.close()

    return body

convertCubetoSTL()
`
}]
} />

Lastly we'll add a very basic `.obj` file called `cube.obj` and add the following contents:

```obj
# Blender 3.1.0
# www.blender.org
o Cube
v 1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
v 1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
vn -0.0000 1.0000 -0.0000
vn -0.0000 -0.0000 1.0000
vn -1.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000
vn -0.0000 -1.0000 -0.0000
vn 1.0000 -0.0000 -0.0000
vn -0.0000 -0.0000 -1.0000
vt 0.625000 0.500000
vt 0.375000 0.500000
vt 0.625000 0.750000
vt 0.375000 0.750000
vt 0.875000 0.500000
vt 0.625000 0.250000
vt 0.125000 0.500000
vt 0.375000 0.250000
vt 0.875000 0.750000
vt 0.625000 1.000000
vt 0.625000 0.000000
vt 0.375000 1.000000
vt 0.375000 0.000000
vt 0.125000 0.750000
s 0
```

Then open a PowerShell or Bash terminal depending on your operating-system and navigate to the folder you recently created and run the following (replacing `<your-token-here>` with your API token):

```bash 
export KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install kittycad
python3 convert.py
```

You should see the following message printed in your terminal:

```
Saving output to ./output.stl
```

Note that the `python3` command might differ depending on what version you've got installed.

Well done, you've completed all of the [onboarding](/account?tab=onboarding_progress). Have a look around the other [tutorials](/docs/tutorials) and [docs](/docs).
