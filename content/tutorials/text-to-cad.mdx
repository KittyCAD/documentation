excerpt: In this tutorial we'll walk through how to use our Text-to-CAD API endpoint in a Python script.
---

This tutorial will walk you through how to use our Text-to-CAD API endpoint from your own Python script. Text-to-cad is a powerful tool that allows you to generate CAD models from text prompts. We recommend trying out our [Text-to-CAD UI](https://text-to-cad.zoo.dev/dashboard) before starting this tutorial.

## Let's Get Started

Before you can use our ML-ephant API, you must have an API key. When you make an API command, you will pass this API key along with your command, so that we can verify it's you. 

You will see your API token below if you are signed in and have already generated one. If all you see is "Generate your first API token," then you currently do not have a token. Follow the steps below to generate an API key:
* Create an account. If you haven't already, you can [create an account here](/account)
* Sign in. Once you've signed up for an account, make sure you are signed in. 
* Generate an API key. You can either go into your [account settings](/account?tab=api_tokens) to generate an API key, or you can press the button below and we will take care of it for you!

## Creating a Script

We will be using the Zoo Python library for this tutorial. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Objectives

Our objective is to use the ML-ephant API to:

- Give a text prompt
- Receive a CAD file in response
- Save the CAD file to our local machine

## Script Building

Let's start building the script.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. You can reference our AI API documentation [here](https://zoo.dev/docs/api/ai?lang=python).

There's two API calls that we are going to make. 
1. [Generate a CAD model from text](https://zoo.dev/docs/api/ai/generate-a-cad-model-from-text?lang=python)
2. [List text-to-CAD models you've generated](https://zoo.dev/docs/api/ai/list-text-to-cad-models-you've-generated?lang=python)

## Imports

When you look at the documentation for these two API calls, you'll find that we need the following imports:

```py
import time
from typing import Any, List, Optional, Union

from kittycad.api.ai import create_text_to_cad, get_text_to_cad_model_for_user
from kittycad.client import ClientFromEnv
from kittycad.models import Error, TextToCad
from kittycad.models.file_export_format import FileExportFormat
from kittycad.models.text_to_cad_create_body import TextToCadCreateBody
```

## Building our Function

let's start building our function. This is where we are going to do our API call to generate a CAD model from text. Since this is done asynchronously, we will need to check the status of the model until it is complete.

First, we have to create the client. We do this by calling `ClientFromEnv()`. This will look for the `KITTYCAD_API_TOKEN` environment variable and use that as the API key. Make sure that you have set this environment variable before running the script.

After that, we will use the `create_text_to_cad.sync` function to make the API call. This function takes in the client, the output format, and the body of the request. The body of the request is a `TextToCadCreateBody` object. This object takes in the prompt that you want to use to generate the CAD model. In the example below, we wrote "design a 40 tooth gear" as the prompt, but you can replace this with whatever you would like. 

```py
def text_to_cad_gen():

    # Create our client.
    client = ClientFromEnv()

    # Call the ML-ephant API to generate a 3D model from text.
    result: Optional[Union[TextToCad, Error]] = create_text_to_cad.sync(
        client=client,
        output_format=FileExportFormat.GLTF,
        body=TextToCadCreateBody(
            prompt="design a 40 tooth gear", # The prompt to use for generating the model
        ),
    )

    # Check if the response is an error
    if isinstance(result, Error) or result == None:
        print(result)
        raise Exception("Error in response")

    # Print the response
    body: TextToCad = result
    print(body)
 
    # Get the ID from the response
    task_id = body.id
```

## Checking the Status

Now that we have made the API call, we need to check the status of the model. We can do this by using the `get_text_to_cad_model_for_user.sync` function. This function takes in the client and the ID of the model that we want to check the status of (the reason we added the line `task_id = body.id` in the previous snippet). We give a time of five seconds before polling again to check the status of the model.

```py
    # Polling to check if the task is complete
    while True:
        # Check the status of the task
        check_result: Optional[
            Union[TextToCad, Error]
        ] = get_text_to_cad_model_for_user.sync(
        client=client,
        id=task_id,
    )

        if isinstance(check_result, Error):
            print(check_result)
            raise Exception("Error checking task status")

        if check_result.completed_at != None:  # Check to see if completed_at is not None (meaning, it's done)
            break

        # Wait for 5 seconds before checking again
        time.sleep(5) 
```

Finally, we can retrieve the final result and save it to our local machine. We first grab the GLTF file from the output using `check_result.outputs["source.gltf"]`. Then we write the GLTF information to a file called `text-to-cad-output.gltf`. The output comes as a base64 encoded string, so we use the `get_decoded()` function to decode it. Lastly, execute our function by adding the line,  `text_to_cad_gen()`

```py
    # Retrieve the final result
    final_result = check_result.outputs["source.gltf"] # Get the GLTF file from the outputs

    output_file_path = "./text-to-cad-output.gltf"
    print(f"Saving output to {output_file_path}")
    output_file = open(output_file_path, "wb") 

    output_file.write(final_result.get_decoded()) # Write the GLTF information to the text-to-cad-output.gltf file
    output_file.close()

text_to_cad_gen()
```
