# 1 Introduction

This article discusses in brief detail the differences between common CAD formats. The article
considers four broad categories of formats: visual, intermediate, modelling kernel, and authoring.
The article summarises with a table of the most common formats and their usages.

# 2 Overview of CAD Formats

## 2.1 Visual Formats

These kinds of formats are almost exclusively based on polygonal meshes. With enough polygons, and
with the observer suitably far away, mesh representations of smooth shapes will indeed appear
smooth. This is, however, merely an illusion; zooming in will reveal the faceted surface.

The most common choice of polygon is the triangle. This is because a triangle sits in a plane
unambiguously. The same cannot be said about quadrilaterals since they can have two possible 'bend'
configurations if their four points do not lie in a plane.

The minimal amount of information required to represent a mesh is an ordered set of points plus a
rule to connect them together into polygons. The most common rules are triangle lists, triangle
strips, and triangle fans.

The first approach, triangle lists, is often preferred because it maintains a consistent winding
order. The winding order is often used in CAD applications to determine whether a polygon is facing
toward or away from its observer.

</figure>

Triangle lists are represented in STL as follows:

```
facet
    outer loop
        vertex -1.0 -1.0 0.0
        vertex 1.0 -1.0 0.0
        vertex 1.0 1.0 0.0
    endloop
endfacet
facet
    outer loop
        vertex -1.0 -1.0 0.0
        vertex 1.0 1.0 0.0
        vertex -1.0 1.0 0.0
    endloop
endfacet
```

To avoid duplicating the points (called vertices) in memory, a separate index list is often used to
determine the vertex order. This is the approach taken by OBJ, a comparable format. The same two
polygons (called faces) are represented in OBJ as follows:

```
v -1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 1.0 0.0
v -1.0 1.0 0.0
f 1 2 3
f 1 3 4
```

Observe how this format needs only store vertices that are unique. Faces are described by
referencing vertices by their index.

For applications such as 3D printing and finite element analysis, knowing only the position of
vertices is usually sufficient. In more complex applications, such as game engines, there is often
more information contained in a mesh required for rendering. The two most common are explored next:
vertex normals and texture coordinates.

On a planar surface, such as a single triangle, the surface normal vector points in the facing
direction directly 'away' from the surface. The same is also true for non-planar surfaces but its
normal vector varies as the surface curves. 3D renderers can use surface normals to compute lighting
per-face; however, this draws attention to the model's facets, removing the illusion of smoothness.

To avoid this problem, 3D renderers compute lighting by considering the average of normal vectors at
the vertices. The vertex normals are then interpolated across the planar surface to produce the
illusion of smoothness. OBJ allows normals to be specified per vertex whereas STL only allows
normals to be specified per facet.

        (Right)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The `vn` element provides vertex normal information in OBJ:

```
v -1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 1.0 0.0
v -1.0 1.0 0.0
vn 0.0 0.0 1.0
f 1//1 2//1 3//1
f 1//1 3//1 4//1
```

It is common for renderers to 'paint' models using an image called a texture. The way this works is
the image is given a 2D coordinate space, commonly a unit square, and each 3D vertex coordinate is
assigned a corresponding 'texture coordinate' in this 2D space. The delicate process of choosing a
texture coordinate for each vertex is known as 'UV unwrapping' and is typically performed by the
model's creator.

The `vt` element provides vertex texture coordinates in OBJ:

```
v -1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 -1.0 0.0
v 1.0 1.0 0.0
v -1.0 1.0 0.0
vn 0.0 0.0 1.0
vt 0.0 0.0
vt 1.0 0.0
vt 0.0 0.0
vt 1.0 1.0
f 1/1/1 2/2/1 3/3/1
f 1/1/1 3/3/1 4/4/1
```

Thus far, the discussion has focused only on STL and OBJ. These are both plaintext formats, meaning
the contents of the file are directly human-readable. This has advantages and disadvantages. One
advantage is they can be used with any program that works with text. Another advantage is it is easy
for a software engineer to understand and verify its correctness. The main disadvantages of
plaintext are the size it occupies in memory and the extra processing time required for a program to
write and interpret the data. The alternative to plaintext formats is binary formats[^1], which
instead are directly computer-readable. As these formats are not directly human-readable, a
specification must be published to precisely define the layout of the data contained within. Three
common binary formats are considered hereafter: binary STL, binary PLY, and glTF.

The binary format of STL is very similar to its plaintext counterpart. There is an 80 byte header
(which is nominally empty), followed by the number of triangles, and terminated with the
per-triangle vertex data. Each triangle requires 50 bytes of storage. In comparison, a single
character in the plaintext format occupies a single byte. The previous STL example, without facet
normals, with no decimal places, and with whitespace removed, occupied 188 bytes. The same data with
facet normals would occupy a mere 100 bytes in binary STL.

The plaintext and binary PLY formats are also similar to each other. PLY was designed with more
flexibility in mind in terms of what data can be stored. Whereas STL and OBJ have a pre-determined
set of data that can be described, the data in a PLY file is self-described by its header (which is
human-readable); the most important data items being reserved and formalised in the specification.
Below is the STL example expressed as a plaintext PLY file. Beyond the header, the plaintext data is
converted to binary trivially based on the self-described property sizes.

```
ply
format ascii 1.0
element vertex 4
property float x
property float y
property float z
element face 6
property list uchar uint vertex_indices
end_header
-1 -1 0
1 -1 0
1 1 0
-1 1 0
3 1 2 3
3 1 3 4
```

The increased flexibility of PLY allows for extensibility and arbitrary user data, at the expense of
being slightly more complicated for importers to process. For example, the number of vertices per
face (essentially, the type of polygon) is variable and therefore unpredictable. It is common for
importers to split polygons with more than three vertices into multiple triangles.

        alt="Polygon Decomposition"
    />
    <figcaption>Figure 5: Decomposition of Polygon to Triangle Fan</figcaption>
</figure>

The naming and ordering of elements and properties is also variable. For example, use of the
property name vertex_index in place of vertex_indices is not uncommon.  
glTF is a relatively new format which has a hybrid plaintext and binary structure. The plaintext
half is encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), itself an ubiquitous storage format, to store
a rich set of user data. The binary half is optional; where provided, its contents are described in
the plaintext half. The format extends beyond mere polygons, facilitating storage of animated scenes
and data for photorealistic rendering techniques.

glTF offers substantially more flexibility than its historical counterparts but at the expense of
verbosity. The following section walks through the glTF version of the STL example described
earlier.

```json
{
    "asset": {
        "version": 2.0
    },
    "scene": 0,
    "scenes": [
        {
            "nodes": [0]
        }
    ],
    "nodes": [
        {
            "mesh": 0
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

The glTF version is identified under the asset property. This is the only required part of the
format. A single scene is (optionally) defined as the default choice; this scene is then defined as
a composition of nodes, which may reference other nodes to form a tree; and the sole node in the
scene instantiates a renderable mesh.

```json
    ...
    "meshes": [
        {
            "primitives": [
                {
                    "attributes": {
                        "POSITION": 0
                        "NORMAL": 1
                    },
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    "accessors": [
        {
            "bufferView": 0,
            "componentType": 5126,
            "count": 6,
            "max": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
            "min": [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0],
            "type": "VEC3"
        },
        {
            "bufferView": 1,
            "componentType" 5126,
            "count": 6,
            "type": "VEC3"
        }
    ],
    ...
```

Similar to PLY, the data contained in a polygonal mesh and its layout is variable. These properties
are called vertex 'attributes' in glTF terminology. The location, size, and layout of the
corresponding attribute data is then described using 'accessors' into 'buffer views' and buffer
views into data buffers.

```json
    ...
    "bufferViews": [
        {
            "buffer": 0,
            "byteLength": 72,
            "byteOffset": 0,
            "target": 34962
        },
        {
            "buffer": 0,
            "byteLength": 72,
            "byteOffset: 72,
            "target": 34962
        }
    ],
    "buffers": [
        {
            "byteLength": 144,
            "uri": "binary-half.bin"
        }
    ]
}
```

glTF has three modes of storage for its buffer data: it may be included within the JSON, using
'base64' encoding, provided as a separate binary file (as demonstrated above), or bundled in the
same file using the binary glTF (GLB) mode. The GLB mode has an extra small header before the JSON
portion to identify itself as such.

## 2.2 Intermediate formats

An important concept underpinning many CAD applications is the idea of a spline surface. A spline
surface uses familiar vertices as before but, instead of joining them into polygons, a rule for
interpolating between the points is defined.

One of the most common and general forms of spline surfaces is known by the acronym NURBS. The
precise definition is technical in nature and irrelevant to this topic; what is relevant is they are
able to represent many kinds of surfaces exactly, including spheres, cones, and ellipsoids.

The familiar OBJ format provides a limited way of defining NURBS surfaces. Here is one such example,
demonstrating an open cylinder:

```
vp 0 0
vp 1 0
vp 1 1
vp 0 1
cstype bezier
deg 1
curv2 1 2 3 4 1
parm u 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1
end
v 1 0 0 1
v 1 0 -1 0.70710678118654757
v 0 0 -1 1
v -1 0 -1 0.70710678118654757
v -1 0 0 1
v -1 0 1 0.70710678118654757
v 0 0 1 1
v 1 0 1 0.70710678118654757
v 1 0 0 1
v 1 1 0 1
v 1 1 -1 0.70710678118654757
v 0 1 -1 1
v -1 1 -1 0.70710678118654757
v -1 1 0 1
v -1 1 1 0.70710678118654757
v 0 1 1 1
v 1 1 1 0.70710678118654757
v 1 1 0 1
cstype rat bspline
deg 2 1
surf 0 1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
parm u 0 0 0 0.25 0.25 0.5 0.5 0.75 0.75 1 1 1
parm v 0 0 1 1
trim 0.0 1.0 1
end
```

It is possible to represent solids as a composition of spline surfaces. Doing so however introduces
ambiguity where the surface joins since it is not possible to match exactly in general. IGES is an
example of an intermediate format which had this issue for most of its history.

To remedy the ambiguity problem, boundary curves are used to explicitly define where surfaces should
join. This combination of surfaces and boundary curves is often referred to as boundary
representation[^2], or 'B-Rep' for short.

B-reps, by necessity, also carry topological information describing the relationship between each
surface. In B-Rep terminology, bounded surfaces are called 'faces', boundary curves correspond to
'edges', and the edges join at the familiar vertices. Note that the vertices themselves are distinct
coordinates resolving the ambiguity problem of multiple edges meeting at a common point.

STEP is an example of an intermediate format which is able to carry B-Rep data, amongst other kinds
of data such as geometric dimensioning and tolerancing information. IGES gained topological
information as part of its fifth version release in 1991 but has since been superseded largely by
STEP.

A solid object (a manifold[^3] in B-Rep terminology) is a collection of faces which combine such
that there is a distinct 'outside' and 'inside' volume.

Surfaces, curves, vertices, faces, etc., are all deemed 'entities' and are each assigned a unique ID
number. Entities can, and often do, reference other entities. References can be made to entities
before they are defined.

```
#10 = CARTESIAN_POINT('NAME', 1.2, 3.4, 5.6);
#11 = VERTEX_POINT('', #10);
```

The vertex_point entity represents vertices. A vertex is a topological construct in STEP and must be
linked to a geometric construct. In this example, the vertex point is linked to a Cartesian point in
3D space.

Edges are typically represented using the edge_curve entity. Edges are linked to a geometric curve
in 3D space.

```
#20 = EDGE_CURVE('', #11, #13, #30, .T.);
```

The final .T. value (which means true) expresses whether the direction of the curve matches that of
the edge endpoints.

Curves are defined in various ways. A common kind of curve, a circle, is expressed as:

```
#30 = CIRCLE('', #31, 2.0);
#31 = AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D('', #32, #33, #34, $);
#32 = CARTESIAN_POINT('', 0.0, 1.0, 2.,0);
#33 = DIRECTION('', 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
#34 = DIRECTION('', 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
```

If it isn't already clear, STEP (or, more precisely, the EXPRESS exchange format) is highly verbose.
Its extensive number of entities make it a double-edged sword, being versatile but complex to
process for a CAD application.

This complexity means that different applications may treat STEP files slightly differently to each
other. For example, one CAD program might not support a particular STEP entity, or handle an
uncommon entity incorrectly.

A typical data hierarchy for a B-Rep model in a STEP file is as follows:

```
advanced_brep_shape_representation (1+)
|
manifold_solid_brep (1)
|
closed_shell (1+)
|
face (1+)
|   |
|   surface (1)
|
face_bound (1+)
|
edge_loop (1+) or vertex_loop (1)
|
oriented_edge (1+)
|
edge_curve (1)
|   |
|   curve (1)
|
vertex_point (2)
|
cartesian_point (1)
```

Common curve entities include:

-   `b_spline_surface`
-   `conical_surface`
-   `cylindrical_surface`
-   `plane`
-   `spherical_surface`
-   `toroidal_surface`

Common surface entities include:

-   `b_spline_curve`
-   `circle`
-   `line`
-   `surface_curve`

Zoo is developing an extension to glTF that allows for solids to be described as polygonal meshes
and parametric boundary representations mutually. This combines the benefits of each representation
and reduces the need for complex and time-consuming conversion steps. In comparison to STEP, the
extension continues to be encoded as plaintext as part of the JSON portion but is substantially less
verbose. The following section walks through an excerpt of a glTF file describing a solid cylinder
using Zoo's KITTYCAD_boundary_representation extension.

```json
    ...
    "buffers": [
        {
            "byteLength": 144,
            "uri": "binary-half.bin"
        }
    ],
    "extensions": {
        "KITTYCAD_boundary_representation": {
            "solids": [
                {
                    "shells": [[0, 1]],
                    "mesh": 0
                }
            ],
            ...
        }
    }

}
```

The majority of the B-Rep data extends the root JSON object. A set of solids are defined in terms of
'shells'; the former is referenced within the glTF scene hierarchy and the latter references other
objects within the extension's own data hierarchy.

Above, a solid is defined in terms of a single shell in its 'same' sense. With the exception of
vertices, all objects have two orientations which are referred to as same-sense and reverse-sense. A
specific orientation is selected using ±1 in addition to the index of the referenced item.

```json
    ...
    "shells": [
        {
            "faces": [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, -1]]
        }
    ],
    "faces": [
        {
            "surface": [0, 1],
            "loops": [
                [0, 1],
                [1, -1]
            ]
        },
        ...
    ],
    "surfaces": [
        {
            "type": "cylinder",
            "xAxis": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            "yAxis": [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
            "radius": 1.0
        },
        ...
    ],
    "loops": [
        {
            "edges": [[0, 1]]
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
```

Shells are composed of connected faces, faces are defined on parametric surfaces bounded by 3D
loops, and loops are composed of connected edges.

```json
    ...
    "edges": [
        {
            "curve": [0, 1],
            "start": 0,
            "end": 0,
            "closed": true,
            "t": [0, 6.28318530718],
        },
        ...
    ],
    "vertices": [
        [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        ...
    ],
    "curves3D": [
        {
            "type": "circle",
            "xAxis": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            "yAxis": [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
            "radius": 1.0
        },
        ...
    ]

}, ...
```

Edges are defined by parametric curves in 3D space and join at vertices. B-Rep vertices are distinct
from mesh vertices, defined by only their position in 3D space.

## 2.3 Modelling Kernel Formats

The collection of algorithms used to compute the geometry for computer aided designs form what is
known as the modelling kernel. This is a fundamental component of CAD/CAM software and it is often
reused between the suites of different vendors. For example, both SOLIDWORKS and NX use the
Parasolid modelling kernel; AutoCAD and Inventor both use the ShapeManager kernel. Some programs
such as Rhino3D and CATIA use their own kernel. Zoo is developing its own GPU accelerated modelling
kernel which can be read more about here.

Modelling kernel formats typically do not offer any more information than comparable intermediate
formats; however, their benefit over comparable formats is that their representation matches the
kernel exactly. As a contrived example, an intermediate format might represent a circular arc using
an angle whereas a modelling kernel might represent a circular arc as three points; these kinds of
differences introduce potential problems as one representation needs to be converted into another.

## 2.4 Authoring Formats

This category describes all formats specific to a particular application, for example, a SOLIDWORKS
part file. These formats are generally proprietary and usually closed, so examples cannot be
provided here. Additionally, measures are sometimes taken to obfuscate the contents of authoring
files to discourage reverse engineering by other companies. Authoring formats are usually binary
encoded and sometimes compressed or even encrypted.

## 2.5 Tradeoffs

Like many things in life, choices are seldom black-and-white but rather present tradeoffs between
desirable and undesirable qualities. The choice for which format should be chosen will depend on
what is needed from the export.

Requirements a user might consider from an export could include:

-   Precision of data exchange
-   Ability to modify exchanged models
-   Software compatibility
-   Protection of intellectual property
-   Speed of data exchange

The introduction described four broad categories of formats: visual, intermediate, modelling kernel,
and authoring. This categorisation produces a hierarchy of detail, where each format contains more
information than the previous. An analogy of a work of fine art is presented to demonstrate:

Authoring files are the original artwork. Sharing the authoring file guarantees precision and
modifyability at the expense of software compatibility and protection of intellectual property. In
this category are found formats from SOLIDWORKS, CATIA, Inventor, Creo, etc.

Modelling kernel formats are akin to a close like-for-like reproduction of the original. The data
exchange is likely to be as precise as the original, less risky than sending the original, but it
may be less convenient to modify. Software compatibility may still be an issue. In this category are
found formats from ACIS, Parasolid, Rhino 3D, etc.

Intermediate formats are akin to a mass-produced print of the original. Much of the original details
such as features are lost but precision still remains in the B-Rep representation. The most notable
formats in this category are STEP, IGES, and glTF when combined with Zoo's
KITTYCAD_boundary_representation extension.

Visual formats are akin to a sketch of the original. Almost all of the details are lost. Popular
formats include glTF, STL, PLY, OBJ, and FBX.

**Table Notes**

1. NURBS surfaces are available without topology but this is rarely used.
2. B-reps available with KITTYCAD_boundary_representation subject to software support.
3. Surfaces are available without topology.
4. Creo and NX part files share the same file extension.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Compressing ('zipping') a plaintext file will reduce its size but not necessarily its processing time.
[^2]: A boundary representation is technically any representation that distinguishes 'inside' from 'outside' areas, which would include polygonal meshes, but the term 'B-Rep' is understood colloquially to refer to the noted form specifically.
[^3]: Non-manifold B-reps are beyond the scope of this page. Nonetheless, for the curious reader, Klein bottles and Mobius strips are examples of non-manifold solids and surfaces respectively.
