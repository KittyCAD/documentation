## 1 Introduction

This article introduces Zoo's Text-to-CAD system. It also provides relevant background, outlines the
underlying methodology, offers usage guidelines, and discusses the system's current limitations and
future direction.

### 1.1 Motivation

What if you could design physical objects simply by _describing_ what you wanted? That’s the core
idea behind Text-to-CAD. It’s a system that takes your text (e.g., “Make a flange with six evenly
spaced holes”) and turns it into a fully parametric CAD model, written in KCL; our in-house CAD
programming language.

Crucially, this isn’t just about generating a mesh for visual appreciation. Text-to-CAD produces
precise, engineering-grade B-Rep geometry. This means you receive a real, editable model ready for
the next step in your development process — whether that’s tweaking dimensions, running simulations,
or sending it directly to manufacturing.

It’s CAD, but faster and more intuitive.

## 2 Background: The Need for Accessible Parametric Modeling

Why did we build this? Aren’t CAD tools already powerful? Yes, but traditional CAD is often hampered
by complexity. Most tools expect users to be fluent in specific workflows, menus, and mouse clicks.
Without that fluency, users face a steep learning curve, or they might outsource their ideas to
someone with the requisite skills.

We believe people should be able simply to _say_ what they want to create.

This initiative isn’t about replacing established CAD tools; it’s about making design capabilities
more accessible. Automation is central to our philosophy, and Text-to-CAD aligns perfectly with
that. By turning natural language into code, and subsequently into geometry, we're lowering the
barrier to entry and potentially speeding up workflows for everyone, from seasoned engineers to
total beginners.

## 3 Technical Context: Boundary Representation (B-Rep) for Engineering Applications

Many people, particularly those from outside the physical engineering disciplines, associate the
phrase "3D model" with a polygonal mesh—essentially, a collection of connected triangles. While
meshes are well-suited to applications such as rendering and gaming, this representation scheme has
limitations that make it a poor fit for CAD. Engineering workflows require the precision and
editability provided by B-Reps[^A].

There are three key characteristics of B-Rep that make it the preferred choice for CAD applications:

- **Precision**: B-Rep geometry represents surfaces exactly – curves are true curves, not
  approximations formed by tiny straight lines. This is critical for engineering applications where
  high precision is required.
- **Editing**: Need to adjust a fillet radius or resize a hole? With B-Rep, it's often as
  straightforward as updating a parameter. Modifying a mesh typically involves manipulating vertices
  directly, which can be complex and error-prone.
- **Workflow compatibility**: B-Rep is the standard representation for many CAD and CAM tools. For
  tasks like running simulations or manufacturing a part, B-Rep data is generally preferred or
  required.

In short, meshes are often sufficient for visuals, while B-Rep is designed for building _real
stuff_.

## 4 The Text-to-CAD System: Approach and Methodology

Text-to-CAD leverages several of Zoo’s internal tools to generate an editable, water-tight solid
model based on user input. The process involves several steps:

- **Prompt parsing**: The user's input text is analyzed to identify parameters, constraints, and
  geometric relationships.
- **KCL code generation**: A series of machine learning models generate and refine KCL code that
  defines the geometry for the requested object. These models utilize our KCL documentation to
  produce high-quality, idiomatic KCL code.
- **Geometry validation**: The generated KCL code is executed feature-by-feature in our geometry
  engine, and the resulting model is tested for validity. Any errors detected are fed back to the ML
  models to further refine the KCL code.
- **File export**: In addition to returning the generated KCL code, Text-to-CAD provides the model
  geometry in the standardized B-Rep or mesh format selected by the user.

## 5 Implementation and Usage

Whether you are a designer, developer, or simply curious about AI and 3D design, Text-to-CAD offers
a straightforward interface to turn ideas into precise models, regardless of expertise level.

- **In the Zoo Modeling App**: Our flagship modeling software is tightly integrated with
  Text-to-CAD. Open the command bar, type your prompt (try _“A flange with a 50mm diameter, 6 holes,
  and 10mm thickness”_), and the 3D model appears, along with the generated KCL code. You can then
  edit the code directly or tweak the model using the app’s GUI.

- **On text-to-cad.zoo.dev**: For a lightweight web interface, visit text-to-cad.zoo.dev, where you
  can experiment with Text-to-CAD directly in your browser with no installation required.

- **Via our API**: If you're interested in integrating Text-to-CAD into your own tools or workflows,
  consider the Text-to-CAD API. Our client libraries (available in Python, Rust, Go, and JavaScript)
  facilitate getting started, whether automating part generation or building a plugin for another
  modeling tool.

```python
# Prompt the API to generate a 3D model from text.
response = create_text_to_cad.sync(
    client=client,
    output_format=FileExportFormat.STEP,
    body=TextToCadCreateBody(
        prompt="Design a gear with 40 teeth",
    ),
)
```

- **As a plugin for your favorite application**: Text-to-CAD can potentially be integrated into
  various software applications. We’ve published a few open-source plugins – for example, for
  Blender and Discord. These can be used as-is, modified, or serve as a starting point for building
  integrations with other 3D modeling tools.

### 5.1 Prompting Guidelines

Here are a few tips for effectively using Text-to-CAD:

- **Be specific**: Generated models adhere closely to the dimensions and constraints provided. If
  important design elements are omitted, Text-to-CAD will attempt to infer the missing details based
  on its training.
- **Be concise**: Shorter prompts (typically 1-2 sentences) tend to succeed more often than very
  long ones. The system supports prompts up to a few thousand words, but longer inputs generally
  take more time to process.
- **Focus on mechanical parts**: Text-to-CAD is primarily fine-tuned to generate mechanical
  components like flanges, plates, brackets, supports, gears, and bolts. However, feel free to
  experiment with other prompts – for instance, try _“a spatula”_ or _“a fun mascot”_.

## 6 Current Status, Limitations, and Future Work

It's important to understand the current state of Text-to-CAD:

- **Ongoing Development**: Text-to-CAD is actively being developed alongside the KCL language and
  our proprietary geometry engine. Its capabilities are evolving in tandem with these underlying
  technologies. (See our public roadmap for more details).
- **Potential for Invalid Geometry**: The generated KCL code is validated and executed before being
  returned. However, if our geometry engine fails to construct a valid model from the code, a 422
  error code may be returned instead of geometry.
- **Non-determinism**: Submitting the same prompt multiple times may produce different results.
  Occasionally, a prompt that initially fails might succeed on a subsequent attempt, and vice versa.

### 6.1 Future Work

We view Text-to-CAD as being in its early stages and have significant plans to expand its
capabilities:

- **Support more CAD features and assemblies**: As the Zoo ecosystem matures, Text-to-CAD will be
  trained to utilize more advanced modeling techniques, including assembling multiple parts into
  complex designs.
- **Physics and simulation integration**: We aim to incorporate considerations like stress analysis,
  material constraints, and manufacturability checks directly into the generation process.
- **Multimodality**: Design concepts are often conveyed using images as well as text. Future
  versions may incorporate visual input alongside language prompts.

## Footnotes

[^A]: It's worth noting that a mesh is technically a form of boundary representation, but its boundary provides an imprecise approximation, particularly for curved geometry.
