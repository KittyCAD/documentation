In [CAD](docs/glossary/cad), an assembly refers to a collection of individual parts or components that are brought together to create a larger, more complex object or system. It represents the relationship and arrangement of these parts in a virtual environment.

In an assembly, each individual part is modeled separately and then combined to create a complete representation of the overall design. The parts can be standard components, such as screws or bolts, or custom-designed components specific to the project.

Assemblies are essential for representing complex objects or systems, such as machinery, vehicles, or buildings. They enable designers and engineers to visualize how the individual parts come together and interact, assess interferences or clashes, and verify the functionality of the design.
