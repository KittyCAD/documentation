When discussing [APIs](/docs/glossary/application-programming-interface-api), a "client" is a machine or application making a request of a [host](/docs/glossary/host) software. Usually a client is requesting the host to return some data, such as all of the posts in your social media feed, or to perform some work on their behalf, such as [converting a 3D model to a different file type](/docs/api/file/convert-cad-file-with-defaults).

Within Zoo, your software (and a lot of others!) is the client, and we are the host. That's why we've gotten a team of excellent software infrastructure engineers together to make our API fast even as more and more clients use it.
