When discussing [APIs](/docs/glossary/application-programming-interface-api), a "host" is a machine or application that has some functionality added to it allowing it to take requests from one or more [clients](/docs/glossary/client). A host may fetch some data or resources for the client, do some work on its behalf, or usually some combination of the two.

With KittyCAD, we are the host and your software (and a lot of others!) is the client. That's why we've assembled a team of software infrastructure experts to make our API services fast and ready to scale.
