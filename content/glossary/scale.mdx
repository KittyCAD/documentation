CAD drawings are created digitally, where the dimensions are represented in units such as millimeters, inches, or feet. However, when the drawing is printed or viewed on a screen, it needs to be scaled appropriately to match the intended real-world size.

The scale in a CAD drawing is expressed as a ratio or a factor that relates the size of the drawing to the actual size. For example:

1:1 Scale (Full-scale): The drawing is displayed or printed at the same size as the actual object. One unit in the drawing corresponds to one unit in real life.

1:2 Scale (Half-scale): The drawing is displayed or printed at half the size of the actual object. One unit in the drawing represents two units in real life.

2:1 Scale (Double-scale): The drawing is displayed or printed at twice the size of the actual object. Two units in the drawing represent one unit in real life.
