KittyCAD is providing the first API for hardware designers. Prior to now, we had not made public the vision for our product. Starting with this blog post, we will be regularly updating our vision for the future and what we are working on.

To begin, I would like to share the vision for what we're developing:

-   **Hardware design infrastructure for the internet:** Millions of companies of all sizes—from startups to Fortune 500s—use antiquated software to design, manufacture, and manage their hardware projects. The majority of this is done offline.
-   **The backbone for any hardware business:** For ambitious companies around the world, KittyCAD makes hardware as simple, borderless, and programmable as the rest of the internet.
-   **Unified platform - A fully integrated suite of hardware design products:** We bring together everything that’s required to design, manufacture, and manage hardware projects: Workflow Automation, a CAD Engine, and Application Frameworks.
-   **Developed for designers - The world’s most powerful and easy-to-use APIs:** We develop the right software so our customers don’t need to stitch together disparate systems or spend months manually completing repetitive tasks.

We've turned this vision into a three phase development roadmap, which we summarize at a high level below, and then break that down into specific features.

# The Phases of our Product Development

We have split our product development into three phases. The majority of the development is being done sequentially, with elements of all three phases happening in parallel. A detailed breakdown of each phase is further below.

-   **Phase 1: Workflow Automation**
    Automation and scripting of the hardware design ecosystem. These are low barrier-to-entry features both for development, and for adoption. Examples being file management, revision control, metadata access and use, integration into other software tools like CI/CD workflows and git.
-   **Phase 2: CAD Engine**
    Addition of geometric creation and edits, expanding on the market entry with workflow automation. Allows the scripting not only of the operations before/after CAD edits, but also inclusive of CAD edits.
-   **Phase 3: Application Frameworks**
    Developing products that combine the workflow automation and CAD engine in a tighter feedback loop, such as auto-generation of CAD geometries based on requirements, automatically pushing a completed & verified design to manufacturing, multi-physics analysis of a part and edits of the base geometry to improve performance, etc..

| Github Actions                      | Integrate with Github Actions so customers can interact with low barrier-to-entry workflow automation features quickly on Github, without hosting their own infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| File Format Conversions             | Provide an API for file format conversion to customers bypassing traditional, GUI-based conversions that are often constrained or require additional licenses in order to run. Additionally, this develops the required infrastructure to allow conversion of files from current file formats to the soon-to-be KittyCAD file format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Metadata: Body Properties           | Provide an API for generating calculated properties of the bodies within CAD files, such as mass, volume, center of gravity, moment of inertia, material properties data, and more. Currently, these values are generated manually within current CAD GUIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Metadata: Surface & Edge Properties | Provide an API for generating calculated properties of the surfaces and edges of CAD bodies. Similar to body properties, these properties are not accessible outside of a CAD GUI. This API provides programmatic access to the features of each surface, such as area, or the boundary curves of the surface. For edges, features like the profile of the edge, length, etc...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Metadata: CAD Feature Properties    | Provide an API for generating the properties of CAD features. These would be the parameters input to the underlying CAD commands that generate the geometry, such as length of an extrusion, elements of a CAD sketch, number of elements of a pattern. These are input commands, not output geometry like the body, surface, and edge features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Metadata: Manufacturing Properties  | Provide an API for adding manufacturing data to bodies, surfaces, and edges. For example, adding a manufacturing tolerance to a surface, which would be later referenced in an engineering drawing. Currently, these values are calculated in spreadsheets, by hand, or similar locations without connectivity into the CAD environment. This data can be added both as static values, and as their own classes/equations which can be re-calculated based on outside values changing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Metadata: Supply Chain Properties   | Provide an API for adding supply chain data to CAD files. Currently, this data is added manually into enterprise systems not digitally connected to the CAD environment. For example, enabling the CAD file to include metadata about the material property constraints of raw material needed for a part, or the specification of heat treatment that must happen after a part goes through a machining step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rendering Engine                    | Provide an API for generating high-quality renderings of CAD files. Often these are manually generated within CAD environments with significant manual setup by the engineer, and impossible to set up the same twice. These renderings are used for downstream manufacturing, design reviews, product documentation, marketing materials, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| File Formats: KittyCAD Format       | Create a new file format standard that natively incorporates the metadata capability described above. This file format introduced the CAD geometry as the "source of truth", accessible as a software object. This structures the data where it can be queried, manually modified, programmatically modified, and re-calculated. This file format uses the developments of the modern graphics and gaming industries, allowing high-resolution representation of engineered geometries meant for processing with GPU technology, without the excessive file size often generated through the decades old file formats used in today's industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Constant Material Properties        | Within the KittyCAD file format, representation of material properties that do not vary across the volume of the body. While some current CAD file formats can define the material by name, they do not include properties such as stress/strain curves and other specific material properties that the part was designed to. Simply a material name such as "structural steel" is insufficient to define which alloy, specification, temper, etc... the part was actually engineered to and this information is documented in an alternative or additional enterprise system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Variable Material Properties        | There is currently no file format in the world that can handle material properties that vary across a single body within CAD. This happens in numerous real world applications, such as welds creating heat effected zones that affect local material properties, or 3D printing applications that have variable heat input across a part or can print continuously with a variable set of deposition properties. This creates major challenges because of the limitations of file formats, where analyzing the performance of these parts is not directly possible. Instead, engineers attempt to create discrete representations of these properties, such as dividing a CAD file into two parts. However this similarly creates major challenges in engineering analysis, where the step change in properties is not realistic, and creates challenges for the meshing and solver technologies within multiphysics packages. We would provide a location-specific property set within our CAD files that could be manually or programmatically defined, and referenced on a location-by-location basis programmatically including by multiphysics simulation software. |
| CAD File Digital Security           | Building on top of the KittyCAD proprietary file format, providing a revokable permission structure, such as through API-keys and/or certificates that allow access to all or specific elements of a CAD file to other users, team members, outside contractors, vendors, etc... There is no current alternative for this today other than password protected zip files which do not provide the ability to revoke permissions, not provide permanent security once they are un-zipped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Analysis Platform Integrations      | Provide integrations to multiphysics analysis platforms, such as the ANSYS API, that allow tighter CAD-to-multiphysics integrations that are overly difficult or impossible today without programmatic access to CAD metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Auto-design Software                   | Create an API based framework to allow machine-learning based iteration of a design, such that the iteration to converge on requirements is driven by machine learning of previous and current iteration results, instead of a more traditional iteration loop convergence.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Reverse generation of CAD files        | Many CAD file formats are not history based, which means that they only output the resulting geometry, not the sequence of CAD commands that were used to create that geometry. Without history, design intent is lost, and makes modification of these files difficult if not impossible. The KittyCAD API and associated intelligence can predict what underlying commands led to the result geometry, and can present high probability options to the end user to choose between. |

| CAD GUI Toolkit | There will always be a market for CAD GUIs, and that market is almost impenetrable given the technical barrier-to-entry required in developing a CAD engine behind the GUI. For developers and companies interested in developing their own CAD GUIs, perhaps to compete with the mainstream CAD GUI market, we would create a framework that allows simplified integration of our CAD engine underneath CAD GUIs developed by any developer, in their language and platform of choice, for either specific or generalized markets. |

| PLM, ERP, MES, MRP Toolkits | Product Lifecycle Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Manufacturing Execution Systems, and Manufacturing Resource Planning, are all outdated enterprise software systems that create extreme burdens for hardware companies. While the KittyCAD API can replace all functionality of these enterprise products, there is a cohort of customers that is still extremely attached to these kinds of products. By providing toolkits to developers providing alternatives to current incumbents in those industries, we allow a new generation of developers to build modern solutions on top of KittyCAD infrastructure catered towards these entrenched enterprises. |
