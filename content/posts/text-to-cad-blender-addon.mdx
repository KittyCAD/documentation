Today we are introducing our [Text-to-CAD add-on for Blender](https://github.com/KittyCAD/text-to-cad-blender-addon). In the world of digital design and 3D modeling, the bridge between conceptualization and realization is crucial. Powered by [Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev/)'s API, this add-on allows users to generate CAD models directly from text descriptions.
### What is Text-to-CAD?
So glad you asked! Our CEO Jessie Frazelle has actually already written a nice [blog post](/blog/introducing-text-to-cad) describing our Text-to-CAD technology.

TL;DR Text-to-CAD transforms text into editable CAD models, distinct from 3D meshes by generating B-Rep surfaces for compatibility with CAD programs.
### Getting Started
To use the Text-to-CAD Blender add-on, users need to have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installed and acquire an [API token from Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev/account/api-tokens). The add-on is straightforward to set up and use, making the transition from concept to CAD model smoother and faster than traditional methods.
### Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Fits smoothly into the native Blender workflow of installing add-ons and includes a keyboard shortcut.
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports various output formats, catering to different project requirements. The files generated by this plugin and Text-to-CAD are always available from your [dashboard](https://text-to-cad.zoo.dev/dashboard).
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, requiring only a text prompt and a few selections to generate a model.
- **Open Source**: The Blender add-on is open source and ready for modification at your heartâ€™s desire.

This is just the start of what you can you do with our [API](https://zoo.dev/docs). Integrate into your own 3D modeling and CAD software of choice!
### Use Cases
The potential applications of the Text-to-CAD add-on are vast, touching upon multiple domains where rapid prototyping and design are essential.

We cannot wait to see what you generate! The Blender add-on is open source, so you can see how easy it is to build your own applications on top of our API. Have fun and remember to leave feedback, that will help us tremendously!
