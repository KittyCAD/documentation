Today we are introducing our [Text-to-CAD add-on for Blender](https://github.com/KittyCAD/text-to-cad-blender-addon). In the world of digital design and 3D modeling, the bridge between conceptualization and realization is crucial. Powered by [Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev/)'s [ML-ephant Machine Learning API](https://zoo.dev/docs/developer-tools/api/ml), this add-on allows users to generate CAD models directly from text descriptions.
### What is Text-to-CAD?
So glad you asked! Our CEO Jessie Frazelle has actually already written a nice [blog post](/blog/introducing-text-to-cad) describing our Text-to-CAD technology.

TL;DR Text-to-CAD transforms text into editable CAD models, distinct from 3D meshes by generating B-Rep surfaces for compatibility with CAD programs.
### Getting Started
To use the Text-to-CAD Blender add-on, users need to have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installed and acquire an [API token from Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev/account/developer). The add-on is straightforward to set up and use, making the transition from concept to CAD model smoother and faster than traditional methods.
### Key Features
- **Easy Integration**: Fits smoothly into the native Blender workflow of installing add-ons and includes a keyboard shortcut.
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports various output formats, catering to different project requirements. The files generated by this plugin and Text-to-CAD are always available from your [dashboard](https://app.zoo.dev/).
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, requiring only a text prompt and a few selections to generate a model.
- **Open Source**: The Blender add-on is open source and ready for modification at your heart’s desire.

This is just the start of what you can you do with our ML-ephant and KittyCAD [APIs](https://zoo.dev/docs/api). Integrate into your own 3D modeling and CAD software of choice!
### Use Cases
The potential applications of the Text-to-CAD add-on are vast, touching upon multiple domains where rapid prototyping and design are essential.

We cannot wait to see what you generate! The Blender add-on is open source, so you can see how easy it is to build your own applications on top of our ML-ephant Machine Learning API. Have fun and remember to leave feedback, that will help us tremendously!
