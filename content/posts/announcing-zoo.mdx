When we had the idea for KittyCAD in 2021, we had only a preliminary idea of how
our product roadmap would evolve. All we knew was that we wanted to build APIs
to allow anyone to build modern hardware design tools. Fast forward to today,
we’ve expanded our product roadmap to also include building certain tools on 
top of our own API. Jess expands on how and why we did this for our
[Modeling App](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app) in her blog post: 
[Putting the KittyCAD API to
work](https://zoo.dev/blog/putting-the-kittycad-api-to-work).

One of the initial goals for our Modeling App was to have it as an open source 
project built on top of our graphics infrastructure, as an example and starting
point for our customers developing their own applications. We are continuing 
this trend by open sourcing the interface to
[Text-to-CAD](https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad), built on top of our
recently launched machine learning infrastructure. 

We have seen two distinct cohorts of customer usage across this range of products.
First, there are a growing number of developers building their own tools,
leveraging our API infrastructure to develop their own automation, platforms, 
and startups. Second, we see customers that solely use the Modeling App and
have no desire to ever implement an API call themselves. Similarly, we expect
the Text-to-CAD user base to also include a large portion of users that
solely use our pre-built, open-source interface, rather than integrate the 
functionality into their own use cases via our API. 

This has left us with a challenge - these two customer cohorts are looking for 
very different things. Different use cases, different documentation, different 
tutorials, and different ways to find our solutions. 

We are solving this challenge by expanding our branding and messaging. Today
as a company, we are changing the company from KittyCAD to Zoo. Our API
infrastructure will have their own branding and messaging, focused on developers.
The KittyCAD brand will be preserved on our flagship product, our 
[KittyCAD: Design API](https://zoo.dev/design-api). KittyCAD stands alongside our new machine learning 
infrastructure, within [ML-ephant](https://zoo.dev/machine-learning-api), our Machine Learning API.

In summary:

- Zoo will be the umbrella branding for the company.
- [KittyCAD](https://zoo.dev/design-api) is our Design API, focused on developers integrating our graphics capabilities into their own products.
- [ML-ephant](https://zoo.dev/machine-learning-api) is our Machine Learning API, focused on developers integrating our machine learning capabilities into their own products.
- We will continue to ship our own applications, marketed to end-users, and open-sourced for developer expansion. Today’s examples include our [Modeling App](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app), [Text-to-CAD](https://zoo.dev/text-to-cad), and [Diff Viewer](https://zoo.dev/diff-viewer).
