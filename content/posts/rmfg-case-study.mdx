## Overview

RMFG is a vertically integrated manufacturing company that focuses on automation to deliver rapid,
high-quality sheet metal fabrication. The company is based in Fort Worth, Texas and was founded by
[Kenneth Cassel](https://x.com/kennethcassel) in 2024. RMFG's primary mission is to make producing
custom hardware faster for companies of any size.

As founder, Kenneth's journey was always rooted in a passion for building things—he started his
career in the trades, doing plumbing, electrical, and other maintenance work, then, over time, he
developed an interest in technology and software development. This amalgamation of worlds, plus a
passion to build software technology that can affect the real world around us, led him to create
[RMFG](https://www.rmfg.com/). RMFG's customers range from smaller hardware startups to larger,
established companies that depend on quick, efficient sheet metal production.

## The Challenge

When it comes to building an automated sheet metal fabrication business, production speed and user
experience are paramount. RMFG needed a streamlined way to process their customers' uploaded CAD
designs quickly and efficiently. One technical challenge they faced was converting 3D CAD files into
a format suitable for smooth, browser-based visualization across devices. This would be a key
feature for RMFG's user-driven interface.

Before discovering Zoo, Kenneth considered developing an in-house solution, but the engineering
resources required—both time and cost—would detract from RMFG's primary mission of operational
automation and could delay their launch by months. As a startup, RMFG needed a partner with an API
that could handle CAD file transformation reliably and effortlessly, without straining their
resources.

## The Solution

After coming across [Zoo on X](https://x.com/zoodotdev), Kenneth realized that Zoo built a File
Transformation API which offered exactly what RMFG needed. The Zoo API allowed RMFG to convert STEP
files to GLTF format, enabling quick, browser-based visualizations of 3D models. This transformation
was crucial in RMFG's workflow: it let customers easily upload their part files to RMFG's website,
visualize them immediately, then configure manufacturing details on the spot. This sets RMFG
squarely apart from traditional manufacturers.

By integrating Zoo's API, RMFG was able to save months of engineering effort and could instead focus
on perfecting their end-to-end automated factory model.

Beyond that, the flexibility of Zoo's APIs offer additional future possibilities for RMFG. While
RMFG currently only uses the Zoo API for file conversion, RMFG envisions potentially expanding its
usage to Zoo's Modeling API and the Machine Learning API (ML-ephant). Integrating these APIs into
RMFG's product flow could support even more customization in design, like allowing their customers
to simply type in a text prompt like: “design me a 18” x 12” piece of sheet metal with 1” 90 degree
bends on all sides and a single 2” diameter hole in the center”, show a 3D model of that design to
them, and then let them order it directly to their door through RMFG.

These future possibilities are another reason why Kenneth is optimistic about a lasting partnership
with Zoo.

> “The Zoo team is phenomenal. When we've hit an occasional bug they're so fast to fix it. It's
> great having a partner that is building software to make our work easier so we can focus on making
> parts.” - Kenneth Cassel, Founder at RMFG

## The Results

-   **Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings**: By implementing Zoo's File Conversion API, RMFG
    saved tens of thousands of dollars and avoided months of development work that would otherwise
    have diverted resources from their core mission. These savings, both in time and money,
    immediately contributed to RMFG's bottom line, offering an ROI that was “immediate,” according
    to Kenneth.
-   **Enhanced User Experience**: One of RMFG's competitive advantages is providing customers with
    the ability to upload, visualize, and configure 3D parts in real time. Zoo's API powers this
    functionality, giving RMFG's customers an interactive experience that allows them to see and
    adjust their designs immediately. This feature has proven invaluable, especially as RMFG
    differentiates itself by delivering a faster, more user-friendly process than traditional sheet
    metal manufacturing solutions.
-   **Future Flexibility and Innovation**: Zoo's modular API offerings support RMFG's future plans
    for enhanced design capabilities. Kenneth is particularly excited about the potential of Zoo's
    Modeling API to create a catalog of pre-configured parts and Zoo's Machine Learning API, which
    could give customers a way to use generative AI to develop custom part designs on-the-fly. By
    offering these expanded functionalities, RMFG can meet more diverse customer needs while
    retaining the flexibility to pivot and grow as new technologies emerge.

## The Conclusion

Integrating Zoo's CAD File Transformation API has been a game-changer for RMFG, not only in terms of
immediate cost savings but also by empowering the company to deliver a highly engaging, interactive,
and efficient customer experience. With Zoo as a trusted partner, RMFG is well-positioned to
continue pushing boundaries in automated sheet metal fabrication. As new API features become
available, RMFG anticipates leveraging them to introduce even more automation and customization to
their product, keeping them at the forefront of innovation in the manufacturing industry. This
partnership with Zoo not only supports RMFG's core mission today but also paves the way for future
advancements that promise to redefine what's possible in manufacturing.
