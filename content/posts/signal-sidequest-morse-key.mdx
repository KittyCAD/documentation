## Why a Morse key?

I was looking for a simple project to use as an excuse to develop some procedure and
documentation templates, and when I discovered one of our colleagues is a ham radio
aficionado, I thought a simple Morse key would be a fun reintroduction to some mechanical
engineering workload. Given that I've now spent most of the last decade exclusively 
working on software systems of one sort or another, a gentle introduction like this
seemed perfect.

The Morse key would give me the opportunity to do a bunch of things I was keen to get
on top of, like:
- Building my familiarity with the Zoo modelling app.
- Ironing out a neat workflow for using FEA tools with geometry built in Zoo.
- Stress testing my thinking on documentation and reporting.
- Getting to grips with my new Bambu printer.

On top of that, it would give me an excuse to play with a microcontroller for the first
time since I built a MIDI drum sequencer some years ago... and hopefully I could pick
up some Morse code along the way too.

## The mechanical bit

This project is a bit 'Mickey Mouse' from a mechanical perspective: it's a single part,
3D printed, subject to basically no load. The actual geometry of the part that I ended
up hooking up to the Arduino is shown below... complete with the sort of external corner
radii that were broadly illegal when I was designing things that had to be machined.

But before I got there via some rapid (and undocumented) iteration, I did actually
work through a proper design process, and I have written up both the design work
and experimental validation of this thing. In both cases, that documentation
follows what I think is a good basis for a document-centric engineering workflow.


### Finite elements, infinite limitations

The list of limitations related to the FEA approach is almost as long as the rest of the
report, but here is the 'Product Design Document' for the part:

### M12s and MDF

Then the following document describes the experimental validation. The last time I did
anything this, I had spent several weeks developing a prototype suspension system concept
for an F1 car, and was in the process of running through a test programme I'd assembled
to try and validate my hand-coded models. In that scenario, I had the luxury of several
Servotest load frames to choose from, but this time... I made do with an M12 bolt and
some kitchen scales, all sat on a 9mm thick piece of MDF on my dining table:

## To the microcontroller

## Introducing Morsdle

At this point, I'd designed, printed, and tested the part. I'd also written the code required
to make an Arduino interpret the signal and feed that to my computer as a keystroke. I
could successfully send an 'A' or a 'B' and watch it appear in my text editor of choice,
but I still didn't actually know Morse code.

Sat on a train from Belfast to Dublin on evening, I spent a bit of time looking for web
pages that offered some kind of Morse code practice, and generally didn't find anything
quite right. This formed an opportunity and an interesting challenge: could I build a
relatively entertaining mechanism for teaching myself Morse code?

Feeding an LLM my Arduino code and some specific preferences with respect to frontend
stack, I was able to hustle together the first version of
[morsdle.com](https://www.morsdle.com) within a few hours. The website was live the next
day.
