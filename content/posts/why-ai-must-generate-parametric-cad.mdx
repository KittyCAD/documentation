There are multiple ways to generate 3D models with AI. You can output **triangle meshes**, generate **B-rep CAD** directly, or use intermediate representations that later get converted.

Which approach makes sense depends on the end goal: visualization, simulation, concept exploration, or manufacturing.

For **CAD workflows**, the goal is more specific than "a shape that looks right." You need a model that holds up to iteration and downstream use in CAM, tolerancing, and inspection. That means the output format matters as much as the geometry itself.

Manufacturable CAD needs two things:

- B-rep geometry
- A clean, well-organized parametric feature tree

## Why B-rep and feature trees are crucial

**B-rep.** Engineers model to manufacture. In production workflows, a mesh, no matter how good it looks, does not provide the stable faces, edges, and analytic surfaces that CAD/CAM relies on. Machinists need **B-rep CAD** so they can reliably select holes, planar faces, edges, axes, and datums to drive toolpaths, setups, tolerances, and inspection.

**Feature tree.** Manufacturable CAD is not just "a solid." It needs **parametric history**. Engineers iterate constantly, and they rely on resilient modeling strategies so changes do not break downstream features. 
When the feature tree is missing or poorly organized, edits become slow, brittle, and error-prone.

The shape itself is only an intermediate artifact. In real CAD/CAM workflows, the work lives in the **intent built into the model** (dimensions, constraints, references) and in the **downstream steps that depend on it** (toolpaths, setups, tolerances, inspection).

So the real question is not "can AI generate a shape?", it is **"can AI generate manufacturable CAD?"**

## CAD-first vs mesh-first generation

There are two fundamentally different ways to generate 3D models with AI:

**1) Native, editable B-rep CAD with a parametric feature tree**

This approach produces true CAD geometry: B-rep with parametric history and a feature tree. Engineers can edit it, constrain it, and manufacture from it directly.

It supports standard workflows like selecting a face or edge and using it to drive machining toolpaths.

Parametric CAD captures engineering intent, not just geometry. The feature tree encodes driving dimensions and constraints (hole spacing, overall width, symmetry), so edits stay predictable.

This is the CAD-first approach.

**2) Mesh-first generation (non-editable CAD output)**

Many other approaches are mesh-first. They often use diffusion or related methods to produce intermediate 3D representations (implicit fields, triplanes, voxels), then extract a triangle mesh.

This makes it easier to produce something that looks like an object, but the output is still raw surface geometry, not editable parametric CAD.

It is like training on compiled output instead of source code. You can see the result, but you have lost the structure that makes changes reliable.

Mesh-first pipelines introduce major issues:

- **Incomplete geometry** (single-view / diffusion model): When a mesh is generated from one or a few images (or partial scans), unseen regions (backsides, occluded cavities, internal faces) are underconstrained. Models often guess or leave gaps, producing missing surfaces, non-watertight shells, or inconsistent thickness - so the result can’t be trusted for CAD or manufacturing

- **Not CAD-compatible:** A mesh model may look correct, but it’s still just triangles - without parametric BREP, feature history, or engineering intent. There are no driving dimensions, constraints, or feature logic, and no stable CAD topology (faces/edges) to drive standard CAD/CAM workflows. 

That is why generating true parametric CAD from the start is fundamentally better for mechanical engineering.

## Why meshes will never work for mechanical engineering

A triangle mesh is an approximation of a surface, not a definition of engineering geometry.

Even when a mesh looks perfect, it collapses the things CAD/CAM depends on:

- **No analytic intent:** In CAD, a hole is a cylinder with an axis, diameter, depth, and often a spec (clearance, tapped, counterbore). In a mesh, a “hole” is just a bunch of triangles arranged in a loop. There’s no axis to reference, no diameter parameter to change, and no stable feature semantics.
- **Unreliable selection:** CAM and inspection workflows need to select faces (planar faces, cylindrical faces), edges (silhouettes, tangency breaks), and datums (axes, midplanes). On a mesh, you’re selecting triangle soup. Even if software tries to infer primitives, it’s a best-effort guess.
- **Mesh-to-B-rep is surface fitting, not recovery:** “Just convert the mesh to CAD” sounds reasonable until you do it at production tolerances. Converting a mesh into B-rep typically means fitting NURBS/analytic surfaces onto noisy, discretized facets, then stitching and healing gaps. This is ill-posed: many CAD models can produce the same mesh, and the conversion has no way to recover the original modeling decisions.
- **No feature tree:** Even if you somehow recover a watertight B-rep, you’re still missing the parametric history that makes edits resilient. You can’t roll back to “before fillets,” change a sketch dimension, then replay the operations. You’re stuck with direct edits, which are brittle under iteration.
- **Unstable topology:** Engineering workflows implicitly rely on stable references (“this hole pattern,” “that mounting face,” “the axis of this boss”). In mesh-first pipelines, any regeneration or conversion step tends to reshuffle topology. Faces split, edges reorder, IDs change. Downstream constraints and toolpath references break.

Meshes have a place (rendering, scanning, visualization), but they’re fundamentally the wrong working format for iterative, manufacturable CAD.

## Why voxels will never work for mechanical engineering

Voxels are 3D pixels: a grid where each cell is filled or empty (or stores density). That makes them intuitive for ML, but fundamentally incompatible with precision CAD.

- **Resolution destroys practicality.** Mechanical parts live in millimeters and tolerances. If you want to represent a 200 mm part and resolve 0.05 mm detail, you’re talking about a grid on the order of 4000³ cells. That’s not a “slightly bigger model,” it’s a different universe of compute and memory.
- **Stair-stepping is not an edge case, it’s the default.** Curves, fillets, draft angles, and smooth blends become jagged approximations unless the resolution is absurdly high.
- **Voxel → surface extraction is still mesh-first.** The moment you need a boundary (for CAM, FEA, drawings), you extract an isosurface and you’re back to a triangle mesh. All the same problems reappear: approximation, ambiguity, no feature semantics, no parametric history.

Voxels can be useful as an internal representation for research or coarse concepting, but **they don’t solve the core requirement: native, editable CAD**.

## Benchmark

The real benchmark is editability, not realism

The question “can AI generate a 3D shape?” is already mostly answered.

The question that matters for mechanical engineering is:

**Can AI generate a model you can safely modify, dimension, tolerance, toolpath, and inspect?**

![mesh vs parametric brep](/documentation-assets/why-ai-must-generate-parametric-cad/bike.webp)

A simple test makes this clear:

- Can you change driving dimensions (overall width, hole spacing, wall thickness) and have the model update predictably?
- Do fillets and chamfers rebuild cleanly after changes?
- Can you reorder or suppress features without destroying the part?
- Can you reference meaningful faces, axes, and planes for downstream CAM and inspection?
- Can you output standards-friendly CAD (like STEP) without repair sessions and broken faces?

If the answer is “it’s a mesh, but it’s a good mesh,” it fails the test. That’s not an insult to mesh generation - it’s just acknowledging that **manufacturing workflows require structure.**

## The CAD Recipe

What “CAD-first generation” actually implies: Generating manufacturable CAD is less like “generating geometry” and more like **“generating a parametric recipe.”**

A real part is a sequence of intentional operations:

- Sketches with constraints (symmetry, tangency, equal, concentric)
- Dimensions with units and design intent
- Features (extrude, revolve, shell, draft, fillet, chamfer)
- Patterns and mirrors
- References (datums, midplanes, axes)
- Clear structure (named parameters, coherent feature order)

That recipe is the real artifact engineers work with. The solid is computed output.

So the core capability is not "produce triangles that resemble a bracket." It is **"produce a robust parametric model that behaves like an engineer built it."**

## What ZOO’s approach unlocks

Because CAD-first systems generate parametric B-rep directly, output is usable in the workflows that matter:

- **Iteration without rework:** change a dimension, regenerate, and continue.
- **Manufacturing-ready geometry:** stable faces and edges that CAM expects.
- **Downstream compatibility:** move into machining, tolerancing, and inspection without betting on fragile conversion.
- **Intent-preserving models:** the model captures why geometry is shaped that way through constraints, dimensions, and feature structure.

## A practical checklist for evaluating AI for CAD

If you are comparing tools, these questions cut through demos:

- Does it output true **B-rep CAD** (not meshes) as the working model?
- Do you get a clean **parametric feature history** (not just a final solid)?
- Can you edit driving dimensions and **regenerate reliably**?
- Are holes, fillets, patterns, and references **represented as features**?
- Can you use output directly for **CAM and inspection** without manual remodeling?

If any of these are "no," you do not have manufacturable CAD generation. You have shape generation.

## Closing

Mechanical engineering is not about producing a shape that looks right. It is about producing a model that survives **iteration** and carries through **manufacturing**.

That’s why ZOO is CAD-first: generating **manufacturable, editable parametric CAD** from the start isn’t a nice-to-have - it’s the difference between a demo artifact and a tool engineers can actually use.
